"Outside the wall, at the part of the grounds farthest from the public road, were a horse and a light wagon, waiting.  The work of excavation was not difficult: the earth with which the grave had been loosely filled a few hours before offered little resistance and was soon thrown out. Removal of the casket from its box was less easy, but it was taken out, for it was a perquisite of Jess, who carefully unscrewed the cover and laid it aside, exposing the body in black trousers and white shirt. At that instant the air sprang to flame, a cracking shock of thunder shook the stunned world and Henry Armstrong tranquilly sat up. With inarticulate cries the men fled in terror, each in a different direction. For nothing on earth could two of them have been persuaded to return. But Jess was of another breed.  In the grey of the morning the two students, pallid and haggard from anxiety and with the terror of their adventure still beating tumultuously in their blood, met at the medical college.  'You saw it?' cried one.  'God! yes -- what are we to do?'  They went around to the rear of the building, where they saw a horse, attached to a light wagon, hitched to a gatepost near the door of the dissecting-room. Mechanically they entered the room. On a bench in the obscurity sat the negro Jess. He rose, grinning, all eyes and teeth.  'I'm waiting for my pay,' he said.  Stretched naked on a long table lay the body of Henry Armstrong, the head defiled with blood and clay from a blow with a spade.",horror,suspenseful,"Jess, Henry Armstrong, Student 1, Student 2","NARRATOR: 
The grey light of dawn seeps into the medical college, casting eerie shadows over the pallid and haggard faces of two students. Their eyes dart fearfully around the room as they enter, their heartbeats still racing from their terrifying adventure the night before. They stop in their tracks at the sight of a horse and wagon waiting outside the door of the dissecting room. Inside, the body of Henry Armstrong lies on a table, his head caked in blood and clay. The air is heavy with the smell of earth and death, and the silence is shattered by the grinning face of the negro Jess, waiting for his pay.

JESS: 
(calmly) 
I'm waiting for my pay.

V.O. (Jess) I hope I get my pay soon. The smell of earth and death is making me nauseous, and I can't shake off the image of Henry's lifeless body. I just want to get out of here and forget this nightmare. But I can't leave without my pay. I need to stay calm and collect my money.

NARRATOR: 
The two students exchange fearful glances, their minds racing with the events of the previous night. But Jess remains unfazed, his expression unchanged.

HENRY ARMSTRONG: 
(weakly) 
Help...please.

NARRATOR: 
The students jump back in shock as Henry's voice breaks the silence. Jess, on the other hand, simply chuckles.

JESS: 
(grinning) 
Looks like we have a live one here.

JESS: 
(serious) 
You won't be telling anyone anything.

NARRATOR: 
The students freeze in fear as Jess pulls out a knife, his eyes gleaming with malice.

JESS: 
(smiling) 
I'm afraid it's too late for that.

NARRATOR: 
The students close their eyes, bracing for the worst. But instead of feeling a sharp pain, they hear a loud thud. Opening their eyes, they see Jess lying unconscious on the ground, a shovel in Henry's hand.

HENRY ARMSTRONG: 
(weakly) 
Let's get out of here.

NARRATOR: 
The students quickly gather their things and make a run for it, not daring to look back. As they reach the safety of the public road, they turn to see Henry walking towards them, covered in dirt and blood but alive. They exchange a look of disbelief before running off in opposite directions.

NARRATOR: 
The next morning, the two students meet at the medical college, their faces still pale with terror.

NARRATOR: 
They make their way to the rear of the building, where they see a horse and wagon waiting outside the dissecting room. Inside, Henry sits on a bench, grinning at them.

HENRY ARMSTRONG: 
(relieved) 
Thank you for saving me.

V.O. (Henry Armstrong) Thank you for saving me. I can't believe I made it out alive. That was the scariest night of my life. I never want to go through something like that again. I owe you everything.

HENRY ARMSTRONG: 
(sympathetic) 
I understand. But for your own safety, you must never speak of what happened here.

V.O. (Henry Armstrong) I can't believe we made it out alive. But now I understand why we must keep this a secret. For our own safety. I can still feel the weight of Henry's body on my back, the smell of his blood and the image of his lifeless face. Never again.

NARRATOR: 
The students nod in agreement before quickly leaving the building. As they walk away, they can't help but wonder if they just experienced a nightmare or if it was all too real.

"The young woman's glance fell upon them with a distant, swift disinterest; then with a lovely smile brightening her countenance and a tender pink tingeing her rounded cheeks, she held out a little gray-gloved hand. When she spoke her voice, full, sweet, and deliberate, proclaimed that its owner was accustomed to speak and be heard.  ""Well, Mr. Easton, if you will make me speak first, I suppose I must. Don't you ever recognize old friends when you meet them in the West?""  The younger man roused himself sharply at the sound of her voice, seemed to struggle with a slight embarrassment which he threw off instantly, and then clasped her fingers with his left hand.  ""It's Miss Fairchild,"" he said, with a smile. ""I'll ask you to excuse the other hand; ""it's otherwise engaged just at present.""  He slightly raised his right hand, bound at the wrist by the shining ""bracelet"" to the left one of his companion. The glad look in the girl's eyes slowly changed to a bewildered horror. The glow faded from her cheeks. Her lips parted in a vague, relaxing distress. Easton, with a little laugh, as if amused, was about to speak again when the other forestalled him. The glum-faced man had been watching the girl's countenance with veiled glances from his keen, shrewd eyes.  ""You'll excuse me for speaking, miss, but, I see you're acquainted with the marshal here. If you'll ask him to speak a word for me when we get to the pen he'll do it, and it'll make things easier for me there. He's taking me to Leavenworth prison. It's seven years for counterfeiting.""

The train station was bustling with activity as passengers boarded and departed. Amidst the hustle and bustle, a young woman's gaze fell upon a pair of men, but her interest was distant and swift.

It was clear she was accustomed to being heard. She extended a gloved hand and spoke, revealing herself to be an old friend.

NARRATOR: 
Her heart swelled with admiration for the marshal, and she couldn't help but wonder if their old friendship could blossom into something more. The glum-faced man, despite his grim demeanor, seemed to appreciate her offer and nodded gratefully. As they continued their journey, the tension between them slowly dissipated, replaced with a sense of camaraderie and understanding.

NARRATOR: 
The two men and the young woman walked together, the sounds of the bustling train station fading into the background. And although their paths may have diverged, their friendship remained strong and unbroken.

"The children were at play in their play-ground one day, when a herald rode through the town, blowing a trumpet, and crying aloud, ""The King! the King passes by this road to-day. Make ready for the King!"" The children stopped their play, and looked at one another.  ""Did you hear that?"" they said. ""The King is coming. He may look over the wall and see our playground; who knows? We must put it in order.""  The playground was sadly dirty, and in the corners were scraps of paper and broken toys, for these were careless children. But now, one brought a hoe, and another a rake, and a third ran to fetch the wheelbarrow from behind the garden gate. They labored hard, till at length all was clean and tidy.  ""Now it is clean!"" they said; ""but we must make it pretty, too, for kings are used to fine things; maybe he would not notice mere cleanness, for he may have it all the time.""  Then one brought sweet rushes and strewed them on the ground; and others made garlands of oak leaves and pine tassels and hung them on the walls; and the littlest one pulled marigold buds and threw them all about the playground, ""to look like gold,"" he said.  When all was done the playground was so beautiful that the children stood and looked at it, and clapped their hands with pleasure.  ""Let us keep it always like this!"" said the littlest one; and the others cried, ""Yes! yes! that is what we will do.""

"Out of the drawer they took about ten little packages of yellow paper, tied with care and arranged one beside the other. They threw these relics on the bed and chose one of them on which the word ""Father"" was written. They opened and read it.  It was one of those old-fashioned letters which one finds in old family desk drawers, those epistles which smell of another century. The first one started: ""My dear,"" another one: ""My beautiful little girl,"" others: ""My dear child,"" or: ""My dear daughter."" And suddenly the nun began to read aloud, to read over to the dead woman her whole history, all her tender memories. The judge, resting his elbow on the bed, was listening with his eyes fastened on his mother. The motionless body seemed happy.  Sister Eulalie, interrupting herself, said suddenly:  ""These ought to be put in the grave with her; they ought to be used as a shroud and she ought to be buried in it."" She took another package, on which no name was written. She began to read in a firm voice: ""My adored one, I love you wildly. Since yesterday I have been suffering the tortures of the damned, haunted by our memory. I feel your lips against mine, your eyes in mine, your breast against mine. I love you, I love you! You have driven me mad. My arms open, I gasp, moved by a wild desire to hold you again. My whole soul and body cries out for you, wants you. I have kept in my mouth the taste of your kisses--""  The judge had straightened himself up. The nun stopped reading. He snatched the letter from her and looked for the signature. There was none, but only under the words, ""The man who adores you,"" the name ""Henry."" Their father's name was Rene. Therefore this was not from him. The son then quickly rummaged through the package of letters, took one out and read: ""I can no longer live without your caresses."" Standing erect, severe as when sitting on the bench, he looked unmoved at the dead woman. The nun, straight as a statue, tears trembling in the corners of her eyes, was watching her brother, waiting.

In the corner, a group of friends laughed uproariously, while a couple at a nearby table shared a romantic candlelit dinner.

[SFX : CHATTER]

NARRATOR: 
The dark-haired young man's smile and nod were met with a curious glance from the narrator. He couldn't help but wonder about the mysterious young man's origins.

NARRATOR: 
(to the dark-haired young man) 
Would you mind telling me, where exactly are you from?

NARRATOR: 
The narrator was taken aback by E. Rushmore Coglan's outburst, but he couldn't argue with his larger theory on labeling people by their origins. However, he couldn't help but be intrigued by the dark-haired young man's response.

NARRATOR: 
(to E. Rushmore Coglan) 
Pardon me, but my curiosity was not altogether an idle one. I know the South, and when the band plays 'Dixie' I like to observe. I have formed the belief that the man who applauds that air with special violence and ostensible sectional loyalty is invariably a native of either Secaucus, N.J., or the district between Murray Hill Lyceum and the Harlem River, this city. I was about to put my opinion to the test by inquiring of this gentleman when you interrupted with your own--larger theory, I must confess.

NARRATOR: 
The dark-haired young man's cryptic response left the others at the table puzzled, but it was clear that his mind was unique and imaginative.

NARRATOR: 
As the night went on, the group enjoyed their meals and engaged in lively conversation. The dark-haired young man shared more of his unique thoughts and perspectives, leaving everyone in the restaurant smiling and humming along to a tune.

NARRATOR: 
As the evening came to a close, the group parted ways, each with a newfound appreciation for the diversity and individuality of their fellow diners.

NARRATOR: 
(musing) 
Perhaps E. Rushmore Coglan was right. It doesn't matter where a man is from, as long as he is true to himself. And that's a lesson we can all learn from the periwinkle on the top of a valley.

"Josefa was standing in her tracks, quietly reloading her silver- mounted .38. It had not been a difficult shot. The lion's head made an easier mark than a tomato-can swinging at the end of a string. There was a provoking, teasing, maddening smile upon her mouth and in her dark eyes. The would-be-rescuing knight felt the fire of his fiasco burn down to his soul. Here had been his chance, the chance that he had dreamed of; and Momus, and not Cupid, had presided over it. The satyrs in the wood were, no doubt, holding their sides in hilarious, silent laughter. There had been something like vaudeville--say Signor Givens and his funny knockabout act with the stuffed lion.  ""Is that you, Mr. Givens?"" said Josefa, in her deliberate, saccharine contralto. ""You nearly spoilt my shot when you yelled. Did you hurt your head when you fell?""  ""Oh, no,"" said Givens, quietly; ""that didn't hurt."" He stooped ignominiously and dragged his best Stetson hat from under the beast. It was crushed and wrinkled to a fine comedy effect. Then he knelt down and softly stroked the fierce, open-jawed head of the dead lion.  ""Poor old Bill!"" he exclaimed mournfully.  ""What's that?"" asked Josefa, sharply.  ""Of course you didn't know, Miss Josefa,"" said Givens, with an air of one allowing magnanimity to triumph over grief. ""Nobody can blame you. I tried to save him, but I couldn't let you know in time.""  ""Save who?""  ""Why, Bill. I've been looking for him all day. You see, he's been our camp pet for two years. Poor old fellow, he wouldn't have hurt a cottontail rabbit. It'll break the boys all up when they hear about it. But you couldn't tell, of course, that Bill was just trying to play with you.""  Josefa's black eyes burned steadily upon him. Ripley Givens met the test successfully. He stood rumpling the yellow-brown curls on his head pensively. In his eye was regret, not unmingled with a gentle reproach. His smooth features were set to a pattern of indisputable sorrow. Josefa wavered.  ""What was your pet doing here?"" she asked, making a last stand. ""There's no camp near the White Horse Crossing.""  ""The old rascal ran away from camp yesterday,"" answered Givens readily. ",fiction,humorous ,"Josefa, Mr. Givens, Lion (Bill)","JOSEFA: 
(smiling) 
That was quite a shot, wasn't it?

V.O. (Josefa) ""That was quite a shot, wasn't it?"" Josefa thought, her smile growing wider. She couldn't believe she had just taken down a lion with such ease. But as she watched the knight mourn over their camp pet, she couldn't help but feel a twinge of guilt. Maybe she shouldn't have been so quick to pull the trigger.

JOSEFA: 
(still smiling) 
Well, I can't take all the credit. The lion's head made quite the easy target.

JOSEFA: 
(slightly intrigued) 
Is that so? I never would have guessed.

JOSEFA: 
(with a hint of sympathy) 
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

JOSEFA: 
(curiously) 
Why was your pet out here in the first place? There's no camp near the White Horse Crossing.

JOSEFA: 
(nodding) 
I see. Well, I suppose it was just a tragic accident then.

V.O. (Josefa) ```
I see. Well, I suppose it was just a tragic accident then. But why do I feel a twinge of guilt? I didn't know he was their pet. What a strange turn of events. I'm glad I was able to save him, but now I feel a sense of sadness.

JOSEFA: 
(softening) 
I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. Givens.

V.O. (Josefa) I never thought I'd feel guilty for taking down a lion. But seeing the knight's grief makes me question whether I made the right decision. Maybe I should have held back. But then again, I couldn't risk my own life. What a strange turn of events.

JOSEFA: 
(pause) 
I couldn't help but notice your hat is a little...crushed.

JOSEFA: 
(amused) 
I'm sorry, but it was quite a sight. You looked like you were in a comedy act with that stuffed lion.

V.O. (Josefa) ""Wow, I can't believe that just happened. I've always been a good shot, but this was too easy. Seeing him with that lion, I almost couldn't hold back my laughter. But now I feel a little guilty. I'll have to make it up to him somehow.""

JOSEFA: 
(smiling) 
I have no doubt. But perhaps next time, leave the lion out of it.

JOSEFA: 
(laughing) 
I'll hold you to that, Mr. Givens.

NARRATOR: 
And with a newfound understanding and a hint of flirtation in the air, Josefa and Mr. Givens parted ways. Ripley Givens with a crushed hat and a broken heart, and Josefa with a silver-mounted .38 and a twinkle in her eye. The satyrs in the woods may have been holding their sides in silent laughter, but for these two, it was just another day in the wild west.

"When Hughie came in he found Trevor putting the finishing touches to a wonderful life-size picture of a beggar-man. The beggar himself was standing on a raised platform in a corner of the studio. He was a wizened old man, with a face like wrinkled parchment, and a most piteous expression. Over his shoulders was flung a coarse brown cloak, all tears and tatters; his thick boots were patched and cobbled, and with one hand he leant on a rough stick, while with the other he held out his battered hat for alms.  'What an amazing model!' whispered Hughie, as he shook hands with his friend.  'An amazing model?' shouted Trevor at the top of his voice; 'I should think so! Such beggars as he are not to be met with every day. A trouvaille, mort cher; a living Velasquez! My stars! what an etching Rembrandt would have made of him!'  'Poor old chap! said Hughie, 'how miserable he looks! But I suppose, to you painters, his face is his fortune?'  'Certainly,' replied Trevor, 'you don't want a beggar to look happy, do you?'  'How much does a model get for sitting?' asked Hughie, as he found himself a comfortable seat on a divan.  'A shilling an hour.'  'And how much do you get for your picture, Alan?'  'Oh, for this I get two thousand!'  'Pounds?'  'Guineas. Painters, poets, and physicians always get guineas.'  'Well, I think the model should have a percentage,' cried Hughie, laughing; 'they work quite as hard as you do.'  'Nonsense, nonsense! Why, look at the trouble of laying on the paint alone, and standing all day long at one's easel! It's all very well, Hughie, for you to talk, but I assure you that there are moments when Art almost attains to the dignity of manual labour. But you mustn't chatter; I'm very busy. Smoke a cigarette, and keep quiet.'  After some time the servant came in, and told Trevor that the frame-maker wanted to speak to him.",comedy,humorous ,"Hughie, Trevor, Beggar-man, Servant, Frame-maker","NARRATOR: 
Hughie enters Trevor's studio, finding him absorbed in painting a life-size portrait of a beggar-man. The beggar himself stands on a raised platform, dressed in a coarse brown cloak and tattered boots. Trevor introduces the model as a ""trouvaille"", and praises him as a living Velasquez. Hughie, feeling sympathetic, remarks on the man's miserable appearance, to which Trevor replies that a beggar should not look happy. Trevor reveals that he will get two thousand guineas for the painting, while the model only earns a shilling an hour. Hughie jokingly suggests the model should get a percentage, but Trevor laughs it off, claiming that painting is almost as hard as manual labor.

TREVOR: 
(laughing) 
Painting is no easy task, Hughie. It takes great skill and patience to create a masterpiece like this one. And this beggar-man, he's not just any model. He is a rare find, a living Velasquez, a masterpiece in himself.

NARRATOR: 
Hughie's curiosity gets the best of him, and he can't help but ask Trevor about the model's pay.

HUGHIE: 
(sympathetically) 
How much does the model get for sitting?

TREVOR: 
(boastfully) 
A shilling an hour.

NARRATOR: 
Hughie is taken aback by the small sum and suggests that the model deserves more.

HUGHIE: 
(jokingly) 
Well, I think the model should have a percentage. After all, he works just as hard as you do.

TREVOR: 
(brushing it off) 
Nonsense, nonsense! Painting is almost manual labor, Hughie. It takes great effort to lay on the paint and stand at the easel all day. But enough chit-chat, I have work to do. Smoke a cigarette and keep quiet.

NARRATOR: 
After some time, the servant enters and informs Trevor that the frame-maker is here to see him.

SERVANT: 
(humbly) 
Master Trevor, the frame-maker is here to see you.

TREVOR: 
(excitedly) 
Ah, the frame-maker! Show him in, show him in.

V.O. (Trevor) Trevor's heart races with excitement as he eagerly awaits the arrival of the frame-maker. He knows this piece is going to be a masterpiece, and the thought of it being showcased in a gallery fills him with pride. As Hughie enters, Trevor can't help but admire his work on the beggar-man's portrait. He's grateful for the model's role in creating such a stunning piece, even if he's not compensated fairly. But that's just the way it is in the art world. Trevor's determined to do this man justice and make him immortal through his painting.

NARRATOR: 
The frame-maker enters, carrying a beautiful frame that he has crafted for Trevor's painting.

TREVOR: 
(pleased) 
Ah, yes, it's perfect. You truly are a master of your craft, my dear frame-maker.

V.O. (Trevor) Trevor's inner monologue: ""Finally, I've captured the essence of the beggar's sorrow. My art is truly perfect. But why does Hughie pity him? He has no idea of the value of my work. Two thousand guineas for this masterpiece, while the model earns a mere shilling. The struggle of an artist is often overlooked.""

NARRATOR: 
As Trevor and the frame-maker discuss the details of the frame, Hughie can't help but think about the poor beggar-man who will not receive any share of the profits.

HUGHIE: 
(thoughtfully) 
It's a shame the model won't get a percentage of the painting's value.

V.O. (Hughie) ""Wow, Trevor really knows how to capture life in his paintings. It's a shame the model won't get a percentage, especially since he's the one bringing so much emotion to the piece. I hope he gets some recognition for his contribution, even if it's just from me.""

NARRATOR: 
Trevor overhears Hughie's remark and laughs it off.

TREVOR: 
(boastfully) 
Oh, Hughie. You don't understand the value of art. Painters, poets, and physicians always get guineas. It's just the way it is.

NARRATOR: 
Hughie can't help but feel a sense of injustice for the beggar-man, who works just as hard as any painter. But he knows better than to argue with Trevor, the proud artist.

NARRATOR: 
And so, Hughie watches in silence as Trevor and the frame-maker discuss the details of the frame. He can't help but think about the irony of the situation - a beggar-man, who represents poverty and struggle, earns a mere shilling an hour for his hard work, while the painter who captures his image will earn thousands of guineas. But in the world of art, as Trevor has mentioned, painters, poets, and physicians always get guineas. And for now, that is just the way it is.

"He seemed unwilling to leave anything to the imagination of a casual observer, and his talk grew presently personal and introspective.  ""I don't know how it is,"" he told his friend, ""I'm not much over forty, but I seem to have settled down into a deep groove of elderly middle-age. My sister shows the same tendency. We like everything to be exactly in its accustomed place; we like things to happen exactly at their appointed times; we like everything to be usual, orderly, punctual, methodical, to a hair's breadth, to a minute. It distresses and upsets us if it is not so. For instance, to take a very trifling matter, a thrush has built its nest year after year in the catkin- tree on the lawn; this year, for no obvious reason, it is building in the ivy on the garden wall. We have said very little about it, but I think we both feel that the change is unnecessary, and just a little irritating.""  ""Perhaps,"" said the friend, ""it is a different thrush.""  ""We have suspected that,"" said J. P. Huddle, ""and I think it gives us even more cause for annoyance. We don't feel that we want a change of thrush at our time of life; and yet, as I have said, we have scarcely reached an age when these things should make themselves seriously felt.""

"Filled with amazement and terror by this apparition of a horseman in the sky--half believing himself the chosen scribe of some new Apocalypse, the officer was overcome by the intensity of his emotions; his legs failed him and he fell. Almost at the same instant he heard a crashing sound in the trees--a sound that died without an echo--and all was still.  The officer rose to his feet, trembling. The familiar sensation of an abraded shin recalled his dazed faculties. Pulling himself together he ran rapidly obliquely away from the cliff to a point distant from its foot; thereabout he expected to find his man; and thereabout he naturally failed. In the fleeting instant of his vision his imagination had been so wrought upon by the apparent grace and ease and intention of the marvelous performance that it did not occur to him that the line of march of arial cavalry is directly downward, and that he could find the objects of his search at the very foot of the cliff. A half-hour later he returned to camp.  This officer was a wise man; he knew better than to tell an incredible truth. He said nothing of what he had seen. But when the commander asked him if in his scout he had learned anything of advantage to the expedition he answered:  ""Yes, sir; there is no road leading down into this valley from the southward.""  The commander, knowing better, smiled.  After firing his shot, Private Carter Druse reloaded his rifle and resumed his watch. Ten minutes had hardly passed when a Federal sergeant crept cautiously to him on hands and knees. Druse neither turned his head nor looked at him, but lay without motion or sign of recognition.  ""Did you fire?"" the sergeant whispered.  ""Yes.""  ""At what?""  ""A horse. It was standing on yonder rock--pretty far out. You see it is no longer there. It went over the cliff.""  The man's face was white, but he showed no other sign of emotion. Having answered, he turned away his eyes and said no more. The sergeant did not understand.  ""See here, Druse,"" he said, after a moment's silence, ""it's no use making a mystery. I order you to report. Was there anybody on the horse?""  ""Yes.""  ""Well?""  ""My father.""  The sergeant rose to his feet and walked away. ""Good God!"" he said.",drama,suspenseful,"Officer, commander, Private Carter Druse, Federal sergeant","NARRATOR:

The officer stood at the edge of the cliff, his heart racing as he gazed up at the horseman in the sky.

OFFICER: 
(half-believing) 
Is this...the end of the world?

V.O. (Officer) ""Is this the end? No, it can't be. The sky is falling, the ground is shaking, but it can't all be over. I need to stay focused, find my man. Forget the horseman, forget the pain. Just keep moving. But what if it's true? What if this is the end?""

Filled with both awe and fear, he stumbled back and fell to the ground. The sound of the crashing trees echoed in his ears, sending shivers down his spine.

At what?

PRIVATE CARTER DRUSE:

A horse. It was standing on yonder rock--pretty far out. You see it is no longer there. It went over the cliff.

V.O. (Private Carter Druse) The horse. It was standing on that rock, so far away. I knew it was a risk, but I couldn't resist. I watched as it went over the cliff, my heart racing with both awe and fear. But now, the truth is too incredible to believe. My own father...dead.

NARRATOR: 
The tension in the air was thick as the sergeant pressed for more information.

FEDERAL SERGEANT: 
(baffled) 
Why would you shoot a horse?

Druse finally revealed that he had shot a horse, and upon closer inspection, realized it was his own father.

They talked loudly and gaily and their cloaks dangled from their shoulders. The people made way for them. At the corner of Grafton Street a short fat man was putting two handsome ladies on a car in charge of another fat man. The car drove off and the short fat man caught sight of the party.  ""Andre.""  ""It's Farley!""  A torrent of talk followed. Farley was an American. No one knew very well what the talk was about. Villona and Riviere were the noisiest, but all the men were excited. They got up on a car, squeezing themselves together amid much laughter. They drove by the crowd, blended now into soft colours, to a music of merry bells. They took the train at Westland Row and in a few seconds, as it seemed to Jimmy, they were walking out of Kingstown Station. The ticket-collector saluted Jimmy; he was an old man:  ""Fine night, sir!""  It was a serene summer night; the harbour lay like a darkened mirror at their feet. They proceeded towards it with linked arms, singing Cadet Roussel in chorus, stamping their feet at every:  ""Ho! Ho! Hohe, vraiment!""  They got into a rowboat at the slip and made out for the American's yacht. There was to be supper, music, cards. Villona said with conviction:  ""It is delightful!""  There was a yacht piano in the cabin. Villona played a waltz for Farley and Riviere, Farley acting as cavalier and Riviere as lady. Then an impromptu square dance, the men devising original figures. What merriment! Jimmy took his part with a will; this was seeing life, at least. Then Farley got out of breath and cried ""Stop!"" A man brought in a light supper, and the young men sat down to it for form's sake. They drank, however: it was Bohemian. They drank Ireland, England, France, Hungary, the United States of America. Jimmy made a speech, a long speech, Villona saying: ""Hear! hear!"" whenever there was a pause. There was a great clapping of hands when he sat down. It must have been a good speech. Farley clapped him on the back and laughed loudly. What jovial fellows! What good company they were!",fiction,optimistic,"Five young men, Farley, Villona, Riviere, Jimmy","NARRATOR:

"Picture followed picture against the grey background. Now Nellie saw herself one winter night knocking at the door of Stepan Lukitch, the district doctor. The old dog hoarsely and lazily barked behind the gate. The doctor's windows were in darkness. All was silence.  ""For God's sake, for God's sake!"" whispered Nellie.  But at last the garden gate creaked and Nellie saw the doctor's cook.  ""Is the doctor at home?""  ""His honour's asleep,"" whispered the cook into her sleeve, as though afraid of waking her master.  ""He's only just got home from his fever patients, and gave orders he was not to be waked.""  But Nellie scarcely heard the cook. Thrusting her aside, she rushed headlong into the doctor's house. Running through some dark and stuffy rooms, upsetting two or three chairs, she at last reached the doctor's bedroom. Stepan Lukitch was lying on his bed, dressed, but without his coat, and with pouting lips was breathing into his open hand. A little night-light glimmered faintly beside him. Without uttering a word Nellie sat down and began to cry. She wept bitterly, shaking all over.  ""My husband is ill!"" she sobbed out. Stepan Lukitch was silent. He slowly sat up, propped his head on his hand, and looked at his visitor with fixed, sleepy eyes. ""My husband is ill!"" Nellie continued, restraining her sobs. ""For mercy's sake come quickly. Make haste. . . . Make haste!""  ""Eh?"" growled the doctor, blowing into his hand.  ""Come! Come this very minute! Or . . . it's terrible to think! For mercy's sake!""  And pale, exhausted Nellie, gasping and swallowing her tears, began describing to the doctor her husband's illness, her unutterable terror. Her sufferings would have touched the heart of a stone, but the doctor looked at her, blew into his open hand, and -- not a movement.",drama,serious,"Nellie, Stepan Lukitch, Doctor's cook","NARRATOR: 
The night was cold and dark, the only light coming from the faint glimmer of a night-light in the bedroom. Nellie, pale and exhausted, stood outside the doctor's house, her heart racing with fear. As she knocked on the door, she could hear the old dog barking hoarsely behind the gate.

"It was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season, that I encountered my friend. He accosted me with excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much. The man wore motley. He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him that I thought I should never have done wringing his hand.  I said to him --""My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met. How remarkably well you are looking to-day. But I have received a pipe of what passes for Amontillado, and I have my doubts.""  ""How?"" said he. ""Amontillado, A pipe? Impossible! And in the middle of the carnival!""  ""I have my doubts,"" I replied; ""and I was silly enough to pay the full Amontillado price without consulting you in the matter. You were not to be found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.""  ""Amontillado!""  ""I have my doubts.""  ""Amontillado!""  ""And I must satisfy them.""  ""Amontillado!""  ""As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchresi. If any one has a critical turn it is he.

It is not the engagement, but the severe cold with which I perceive you are afflicted. The vaults are insufferably damp. They are encrusted with nitre.""  ""Let us go, nevertheless. The cold is merely nothing. Amontillado! You have been imposed upon. And as for Luchresi, he cannot distinguish Sherry from Amontillado.""

"The Skin Horse had lived longer in the nursery than any of the others. He was so old that his brown coat was bald in patches and showed the seams underneath, and most of the hairs in his tail had been pulled out to string bead necklaces. He was wise, for he had seen a long succession of mechanical toys arrive to boast and swagger, and by-and-by break their mainsprings and pass away, and he knew that they were only toys, and would never turn into anything else. For nursery magic is very strange and wonderful, and only those playthings that are old and wise and experienced like the Skin Horse understand all about it.  ""What is REAL?"" asked the Rabbit one day, when they were lying side by side near the nursery fender, before Nana came to tidy the room. ""Does it mean having things that buzz inside you and a stick-out handle?""  ""Real isn't how you are made,"" said the Skin Horse. ""It's a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real.""  ""Does it hurt?"" asked the Rabbit.  ""Sometimes,"" said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful. ""When you are Real you don't mind being hurt.""  ""Does it happen all at once, like being wound up,"" he asked, ""or bit by bit?""  ""It doesn't happen all at once,"" said the Skin Horse. ""You become. It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand.""  ""I suppose you are Real?"" said the Rabbit. And then he wished he had not said it, for he thought the Skin Horse might be sensitive. But the Skin Horse only smiled.",fiction,optimistic,"Skin Horse, Rabbit, Nana","SKIN HORSE:

RABBIT: 
(dreamily) 
Yes, but I never thought it could happen to me.

""Real... like the Skin Horse? But how? I have so much to learn. Maybe one day, I'll be loved enough to become Real. It's a gradual process, like growing up. But for now, I'll just enjoy the magic of this nursery and the warmth of the Skin Horse's smile.""

SKIN HORSE: 
(nodding) 
And it's not just about how you look, Rabbit. Being Real is about what's inside too.

V.O. (Skin Horse) Skin Horse thought, ""Yes, being Real is more than just appearances. It's about the love within. Look at me, worn and tattered, but I am cherished and Real because of the love of a child. And now, Rabbit, you too can feel the joy of being Real.""

V.O. (Rabbit) Wow, the Skin Horse is so wise. I never thought about becoming Real before, but now I can't stop thinking about it. Is that why I feel so empty inside? I want to be loved and cherished by a child, to have a purpose. Maybe then I'll truly be alive.

SKIN HORSE: 
(chuckling) 
No, my dear. It's about love, and kindness, and being able to truly feel.

NANA: 
(nodding) 
And when you are Real, you won't mind being hurt. Because love makes you strong.

SKIN HORSE: 
(sadly) 
But not everyone understands that, Rabbit.

RABBIT: 
(looking worried) 
What do you mean?

SKIN HORSE: 
(serious) 
Some people only see the outside, and they might think you are ugly.

RABBIT: 
(sadly) 
But I don't want to be ugly.

The Skin Horse and Nana exchange a knowing look, understanding the Rabbit's fears.

SKIN HORSE: 
(softly) 
But you see, Rabbit, when you are Real, you can't be ugly to those who truly understand.

RABBIT: 
(eyes lighting up) 
Really?

NANA: 
(smiling) 
Absolutely. And by the time you are Real, you won't care about those who don't understand.

RABBIT: 
(happily) 
I can't wait to become Real!

V.O. (Rabbit) I can't wait to become Real! The Skin Horse is right, it doesn't happen all at once. But being loved by a child, having a purpose, and becoming beautiful despite the wear and tear - that's worth the wait. I can feel it, I am already on my way to becoming Real.

SKIN HORSE: 
(proudly) 
You're already on your way, Rabbit. Just keep loving and being loved.

NARRATOR: 
And as Nana and the Skin Horse watched the Rabbit play with the other toys, they knew that he was already becoming Real. And in the magical nursery, that was the greatest gift of all.

"I walked and walked along the cold wet sand, making my chattering teeth warble in honour of cold and hunger, when suddenly, as I was carefully searching for something to eat behind one of the empty crates, I perceived behind it, crouching on the ground, a figure in woman's clothes dank with the rain and clinging fast to her stooping shoulders. Standing over her, I watched to see what she was doing. It appeared that she was digging a trench in the sand with her hands--digging away under one of the crates.  ""Why are you doing that?"" I asked, crouching down on my heels quite close to her.  She gave a little scream and was quickly on her legs again. Now that she stood there staring at me, with her wide-open grey eyes full of terror, I perceived that it was a girl of my own age, with a very pleasant face embellished unfortunately by three large blue marks. This spoilt her, although these blue marks had been distributed with a remarkable sense of proportion, one at a time, and all were of equal size--two under the eyes, and one a little bigger on the forehead just over the bridge of the nose. This symmetry was evidently the work of an artist well inured to the business of spoiling the human physiognomy.  The girl looked at me, and the terror in her eyes gradually died out... She shook the sand from her hands, adjusted her cotton head-gear, cowered down, and said:  ""I suppose you too want something to eat? Dig away then! My hands are tired. Over there""--she nodded her head in the direction of a booth--""there is bread for certain ... and sausages too... That booth is still carrying on business.""  I began to dig. She, after waiting a little and looking at me, sat down beside me and began to help me.  We worked in silence. I cannot say now whether I thought at that moment of the criminal code, of morality, of proprietorship, and all the other things about which, in the opinion of many experienced persons, one ought to think every moment of one's life. Wishing to keep as close to the truth as possible, I must confess that apparently I was so deeply engaged in digging under the crate that I completely forgot about everything else except this one thing: What could be inside that crate?

"Olenka, the daughter of the retired collegiate assessor, Plemyanniakov, was sitting in her back porch, lost in thought. It was hot, the flies were persistent and teasing, and it was pleasant to reflect that it would soon be evening. Dark rainclouds were gathering from the east, and bringing from time to time a breath of moisture in the air.  Kukin, who was the manager of an open-air theatre called the Tivoli, and who lived in the lodge, was standing in the middle of the garden looking at the sky.  ""Again!"" he observed despairingly. ""It's going to rain again! Rain every day, as though to spite me. I might as well hang myself! It's ruin! Fearful losses every day.""  He flung up his hands, and went on, addressing Olenka:  ""There! that's the life we lead, Olga Semyonovna. It's enough to make one cry. One works and does one's utmost, one wears oneself out, getting no sleep at night, and racks one's brain what to do for the best. And then what happens? To begin with, one's public is ignorant, boorish. I give them the very best operetta, a dainty masque, first rate music-hall artists. But do you suppose that's what they want! They don't understand anything of that sort. They want a clown; what they ask for is vulgarity. And then look at the weather! Almost every evening it rains. It started on the tenth of May, and it's kept it up all May and June. It's simply awful! The public doesn't come, but I've to pay the rent just the same, and pay the artists.""  The next evening the clouds would gather again, and Kukin would say with an hysterical laugh:  ""Well, rain away, then! Flood the garden, drown me! Damn my luck in this world and the next! Let the artists have me up! Send me to prison! -- to Siberia! -- the scaffold! Ha, ha, ha!""  And next day the same thing.  Olenka listened to Kukin with silent gravity, and sometimes tears came into her eyes. In the end his misfortunes touched her; she grew to love him. He was a small thin man, with a yellow face, and curls combed forward on his forehead. He spoke in a thin tenor; as he talked his mouth worked on one side, and there was always an expression of despair on his face; yet he aroused a deep and genuine affection in her.

"This did not long sustain his drooping spirit. He was mentally adrift upon the Hints and Helps to Young Men in Business and Social Relations, which had suggested to him his present enterprise, when the appearance of a second youth, taller and broader than himself, with a shock of light curling hair and a crop of freckles that advertised a rich soil threw him a lifeline. He put his thumbs to his lips and whistled in a peculiarly ear-splitting way. The two boys had sat on the same bench at Sunday-school not three hours before; yet what a change had come over the world for one of them since then!  ""Hello! Where you goin', Ab?"" asked the newcomer, gruffly.  ""Callin',"" replied the boy in the collar, laconically, but with carefully averted gaze.  ""On the girls?"" inquired the other, awestruck. In Mount Pisgah you saw the girls home from night church, socials, or parties; you could hang over the gate; and you might walk with a girl in the cemetery of a Sunday afternoon; but to ring a front-door bell and ask for Miss Heart's Desire one must have been in long trousers at least three years”and the two boys confronted in the dusty road had worn these dignifying garments barely six months.

Ross and Champe were neighbors, comrades in all sorts of mischief; he was in doubt whether to halt Abner and pummel him, or propose to enlist under his banner.  ""Do you reckon you could?"" he debated, trotting along by the irresponsive Jilton boy.  ""Run home to your mother,"" growled the originator of the plan, savagely. ""You ain't old enough to call on girls; anybody can see that; but I am, and I'm going to call on Champe Claiborne.""  Again the name acted as a spur on Ross. ""With your collar and boots all dirty?"" he jeered. ""They won't know you're callin'.""  The boy in the road stopped short in his dusty tracks. He was an intense creature, and he whitened at the tragic insinuation, longing for the wholesome stay and companionship of freckle-faced Ross.

"Mr. Pneumonia was not what you would call a chivalric old gentleman. A mite of a little woman with blood thinned by California zephyrs was hardly fair game for the red-fisted, short-breathed old duffer. But Johnsy he smote; and she lay, scarcely moving, on her painted iron bedstead, looking through the small Dutch window-panes at the blank side of the next brick house.  One morning the busy doctor invited Sue into the hallway with a shaggy, gray eyebrow.  ""She has one chance in - let us say, ten,"" he said, as he shook down the mercury in his clinical thermometer. "" And that chance is for her to want to live. This way people have of lining-u on the side of the undertaker makes the entire pharmacopoeia look silly. Your little lady has made up her mind that she's not going to get well. Has she anything on her mind?""  ""She - she wanted to paint the Bay of Naples some day."" said Sue.  ""Paint? - bosh! Has she anything on her mind worth thinking twice - a man for instance?""  ""A man?"" said Sue, with a jew's-harp twang in her voice. ""Is a man worth - but, no, doctor; there is nothing of the kind.""  ""Well, it is the weakness, then,"" said the doctor. ""I will do all that science, so far as it may filter through my efforts, can accomplish. But whenever my patient begins to count the carriages in her funeral procession I subtract 50 per cent from the curative power of medicines. If you will get her to ask one question about the new winter styles in cloak sleeves I will promise you a one-in-five chance for her, instead of one in ten.""  After the doctor had gone Sue went into the workroom and cried a Japanese napkin to a pulp. Then she swaggered into Johnsy's room with her drawing board, whistling ragtime.  Johnsy lay, scarcely making a ripple under the bedclothes, with her face toward the window. Sue stopped whistling, thinking she was asleep.  She arranged her board and began a pen-and-ink drawing to illustrate a magazine story. Young artists must pave their way to Art by drawing pictures for magazine stories that young authors write to pave their way to Literature.

Johnsy, a frail and sickly woman, lies motionless on the bed, her gaze fixed on the window. Sue's pencil scratches against the paper as she sketches a pair of elegant riding trousers and a monocle, lost in her work. Suddenly, she hears a faint sound coming from Johnsy's direction. She pauses, thinking she's asleep, but the sound persists. Sue's heart quickens as she realizes Johnsy is whispering something. Could this be the first sign of her wanting to live?

"Every Sunday he met in this very spot Monsieur Sauvage, a stout, jolly, little man, a draper in the Rue Notre Dame de Lorette, and also an ardent fisherman. They often spent half the day side by side, rod in hand and feet dangling over the water, and a warm friendship had sprung up between the two.  Some days they did not speak; at other times they chatted; but they understood each other perfectly without the aid of words, having similar tastes and feelings.  In the spring, about ten o'clock in the morning, when the early sun caused a light mist to float on the water and gently warmed the backs of the two enthusiastic anglers, Morissot would occasionally remark to his neighbor:  ""My, but it's pleasant here.""  To which the other would reply:  ""I can't imagine anything better!""  And these few words sufficed to make them understand and appreciate each other.  In the autumn, toward the close of day, when the setting sun shed a blood-red glow over the western sky, and the reflection of the crimson clouds tinged the whole river with red, brought a glow to the faces of the two friends, and gilded the trees, whose leaves were already turning at the first chill touch of winter, Monsieur Sauvage would sometimes smile at Morissot, and say:  ""What a glorious spectacle!""  And Morissot would answer, without taking his eyes from his float:  ""This is much better than the boulevard, isn't it?""  As soon as they recognized each other they shook hands cordially, affected at the thought of meeting under such changed circumstances.  Monsieur Sauvage, with a sigh, murmured:  ""These are sad times!""  Morissot shook his head mournfully.  ""And such weather! This is the first fine day of the year.""  The sky was, in fact, of a bright, cloudless blue.  They walked along, side by side, reflective and sad.  ""And to think of the fishing!"" said Morissot. ""What good times we used to have!""  ""When shall we be able to fish again?"" asked Monsieur Sauvage.  They entered a small cafe and took an absinthe together, then resumed their walk along the pavement.  Morissot stopped suddenly.  ""Shall we have another absinthe?"" he said.  ""If you like,"" agreed Monsieur Sauvage.  And they entered another wine shop.  They were quite unsteady when they came out, owing to the effect of the alcohol on their empty stomachs. ",drama,serious,"Monsieur Sauvage, Morissot, Colonel Dumoulin","NARRATOR:

"There is a great deal to recommend a plains journey at first. Later, there is nothing at all to recommend it. It has the same monotony as a voyage at sea, only there is less living room, and, instead of being carried, you must progress to a great extent by your own volition. Also the food is coarse, the water poor, and you cannot bathe. To a plainsman, or a man who has the instinct, these things are as nothing in comparison with the charm of the outdoor life, and the pleasing tingling of adventure. But woman is a creature wedded to comfort. She also has a strange instinctive desire to be entirely alone every once in a while, probably because her experiences, while not less numerous than man's, are mainly psychical, and she needs occasionally time to get ""thought up to date."" So Miss Caldwell began to get very impatient.  The afternoon of the sixth day Alfred, Miss Caldwell, and Allen rode along side by side. Alfred was telling a self-effacing story of adventure, and Miss Caldwell was listening carelessly because she had nothing else to do. Allen chaffed lazily when the fancy took him.  ""I happened to have a limb broken at the time,"" Alfred was observing, parenthetically, in his soft tones, ""and so----""  ""What kind of a limb?"" asked the young Easterner, with direct brutality. He glanced with a half-humourous aside at the girl, to whom the little man had been mainly addressing himself.  Alfred hesitated, blushed, lost the thread of his tale, and finally in great confusion reined back his horse by the harsh Spanish bit. He fell to the rear of the little wagon-train, where he hung his head, and went hot and cold by turns in thinking of such an indiscretion before a lady.  The young Easterner spurred up on the right of the girl's mount.  ""He's the queerest little fellow I ever saw!"" he observed, with a laugh. ""Sorry to spoil his story. Was it a good one?""  ""It might have been if you hadn't spoiled it,"" answered the girl, flicking her horse's ears mischievously. The animal danced. ""What did you do it for?""  ""Oh, just to see him squirm. He'll think about that all the rest of the afternoon, and will hardly dare look you in the face next time you meet.""  ""I know. Isn't he funny?

German soldiers could be seen along the roads, on the edges of fields, standing in front of gates or chatting outside cafes. They covered the soil like African locusts.  The officer said, with a wave of his hand:  ""If I had been in command, I'd have taken Paris, burned everything, killed everybody. No more France!""  The Englishman, through politeness, replied simply:  ""Ah! yes.""  He went on:  ""In twenty years all Europe, all of it, will belong to us. Prussia is more than a match for all of them.""

"One glance over the crumbling wall at the edge was generally sufficient for a visitor of even the strongest nerves. There was a sheer drop of more than a mile straight down, and at the distant bottom were jagged rocks and stunted trees that looked, in the blue haze, like shrubbery.  ""This is the spot,"" said the man to himself, ""and to-morrow morning is the time.""  John Bodman had planned his crime as grimly and relentlessly, and as coolly, as ever he had concocted a deal on the Stock Exchange. There was no thought in his mind of mercy for his unconscious victim. His hatred had carried him far.  The next morning after breakfast, he said to his wife: ""I intend to take a walk in the mountains. Do you wish to come with me?""  ""Yes,"" she answered briefly.  ""Very well, then,"" he said; ""I shall be ready at nine o'clock.""  ""I shall be ready at nine o'clock,"" she repeated after him.  At that hour they left the hotel together, to which he was shortly to return alone. They spoke no word to each other on their way to the Hanging Outlook. The path was practically level, skirting the mountains, for the Hanging Outlook was not much higher above the sea than the hotel.  John Bodman had formed no fixed plan for his procedure when the place was reached. He resolved to be guided by circumstances. Now and then a strange fear arose in his mind that she might cling to him and possibly drag him over the precipice with her. He found himself wondering whether she had any premonition of her fate, and one of his reasons for not speaking was the fear that a tremor in his voice might possibly arouse her suspicions. He resolved that his action should be sharp and sudden, that she might have no chance either to help herself or to drag him with her. Of her screams in that desolate region he had no fear. No one could reach the spot except from the hotel, and no one that morning had left the house, even for an expedition to the glacier--one of the easiest and most popular trips from the place.  Curiously enough, when they came within sight of the Hanging Outlook, Mrs. Bodman stopped and shuddered. Bodman looked at her through the narrow slits of his veiled eyes, and wondered again if she had any suspicion.

John leaves his wife's lifeless body at the bottom of the cliff and heads back to the hotel alone, his mind already consumed by thoughts of his next deal on the Stock Exchange.

"Vivienne was about twenty-one. She was of the purest Saxon type. Her hair was a ruddy golden, each filament of the neatly gathered mass shining with its own lustre and delicate graduation of colour. In perfect harmony were her ivory-clear complexion and deep sea-blue eyes that looked upon the world with the ingenuous calmness of a mermaid or the pixie of an undiscovered mountain stream. Her frame was strong and yet possessed the grace of absolute naturalness. And yet with all her Northern clearness and frankness of line and colouring, there seemed to be something of the tropics in her -- something of languor in the droop of her pose, of love of ease in her ingenious complacency of satisfaction and comfort in the mere act of breathing -- something that seemed to claim for her a right as a perfect work of nature to exist and be admired equally with a rare flower or some beautiful, milk-white dove among its sober-hued companions.  She was dressed in a white waist and dark skirt -- that discreet masquerade of goose-girl and duchess.  ""Vivienne,"" said Hartley, looking at her pleadingly, ""you did not answer my last letter. It was only by nearly a week's search that I found where you had moved to. Why have you kept me in suspense when you knew how anxiously I was waiting to see you and hear from you?""  The girl looked out the window dreamily.  ""Mr. Hartley,"" she said hesitatingly, ""I hardly know what to say to you. I realize all the advantages of your offer, and sometimes I feel sure that I could be contented with you. But, again, I am doubtful. I was born a city girl, and I am afraid to bind myself to a quiet suburban life.""  ""My dear girl,"" said Hartley, ardently, ""have I not told you that you shall have everything that your heart can desire that is in my power to give you? You shall come to the city for the theatres, for shopping and to visit your friends as often as you care to. You can trust me, can you not?""  ""To the fullest,"" she said, turning her frank eyes upon him with a smile. ""I know you are the kindest of men, and that the girl you get will be a lucky one. I learned all about you when I was at the Montgomerys'.""  ""Ah!"" exclaimed Hartley, with a tender, reminiscent light in his eye; ""I remember well the evening I first saw you at the Montgomerys'. Mrs. Montgomery was sounding your praises to me all the evening. And she hardly did you justice. I shall never forget that supper. Come, Vivienne, promise me. I want you. You'll never regret coming with me. No one else will ever give you as pleasant a home.""  The girl sighed and looked down at her folded hands.

She's right. Everyone has nothing but praise for you, Mr. Hartley. And I can see why. You have a way of making a girl feel special.

V.O. (Hloise) Heloise couldn't help but admire Vivienne's beauty. She was everything she wished to be, and it seemed that even Mr. Hartley was captivated by her. But as she heard his words, she couldn't deny the slight pang of jealousy. Would she ever find someone who could make her feel as special as Vivienne?

HARTLEY:

I remember the first time I saw you, Vivienne. It was at the Montgomerys' party. I couldn't take my eyes off of you. And Mrs. Montgomery couldn't stop singing your praises.

VIVIENNE: 
(smiling) 
I'll never forget that night. And the delicious supper you prepared for us.

HARTLEY:

So, my dear, will you be mine? Will you leave the city and come live with me in the suburbs? I promise, you'll never regret it.

I trust you, Hartley. I know you'll give me the life I've always dreamed of. Yes, I'll be yours.

"Who and where was Miggles? The Judge, our authority, did not remember the name, and he knew the country thoroughly. The Washoe traveler thought Miggles must keep a hotel. We only knew that we were stopped by high water in front and rear, and that Miggles was our rock of refuge. A ten minutes splashing through a tangled by- road, scarcely wide enough for the stage, and we drew up before a barred and boarded gate in a wide stone wall or fence about eight feet high. Evidently Miggles's, and evidently Miggles did not keep a hotel.  The driver got down and tried the gate. It was securely locked. Miggles! O Miggles!""  No answer.  ""Migg-ells! You Miggles!"" continued the driver, with rising wrath.  ""Migglesy!"" joined the expressman, persuasively. ""O Miggy! Mig!""  But no reply came from the apparently insensate Miggles. The Judge, who had finally got the window down, put his head out and propounded a series of questions, which if answered categorically would have undoubtedly elucidated the whole mystery, but which the driver evaded by replying that ""if we didn't want to sit in the coach all night, we had better rise up and sing out for Miggles.""  So we rose up and called on Miggles in chorus; then separately. And when we had finished, a Hibernian fellow-passenger from the roof called for ""Maygells!"" whereat we all laughed. While we were laughing, the driver cried ""Shoo!""  We listened. To our infinite amazement the chorus of ""Miggles"" was repeated from the other side of the wall, even to the final and supplemental ""Maygells.""  ""Extraordinary echo,"" said the Judge.  ""Extraordinary damned skunk!"" roared the driver, contemptuously. ""Come out of that, Miggles, and show yourself! Be a man, Miggles! Don't hide in the dark; I wouldn't if I were you, Miggles,"" continued Yuba Bill, now dancing about in an excess of fury.  ""Miggles!"" continued the voice. ""O Miggles!""  ""My good man!

"Corley's stride acknowledged the compliment. The swing of his burly body made his friend execute a few light skips from the path to the roadway and back again. Corley was the son of an inspector of police and he had inherited his father's frame and gut. He walked with his hands by his sides, holding himself erect and swaying his head from side to side. His head was large, globular and oily; it sweated in all weathers; and his large round hat, set upon it sideways, looked like a bulb which had grown out of another. He always stared straight before him as if he were on parade and, when he wished to gaze after someone in the street, it was necessary for him to move his body from the hips. At present he was about town. Whenever any job was vacant a friend was always ready to give him the hard word. He was often to be seen walking with policemen in plain clothes, talking earnestly. He knew the inner side of all affairs and was fond of delivering final judgments. He spoke without listening to the speech of his companions. His conversation was mainly about himself what he had said to such a person and what such a person had said to him and what he had said to settle the matter. When he reported these dialogues he aspirated the first letter of his name after the manner of Florentines.  Lenehan offered his friend a cigarette. As the two young men walked on through the crowd Corley occasionally turned to smile at some of the passing girls but Lenehan's gaze was fixed on the large faint moon circled with a double halo. He watched earnestly the passing of the grey web of twilight across its face. At length he said:  ""Well... tell me, Corley, I suppose you'll be able to pull it off all right, eh?""  Corley closed one eye expressively as an answer.  ""Is she game for that?"" asked Lenehan dubiously. ""You can never know women.""  ""She's all right,"" said Corley. ""I know the way to get around her, man. She's a bit gone on me.""  ""You're what I call a gay Lothario,"" said Lenehan. ""And the proper kind of a Lothario, too!""  A shade of mockery relieved the servility of his manner. To save himself he had the habit of leaving his flattery open to the interpretation of raillery. But Corley had not a subtle mind.  ""There's nothing to touch a good slavey,"" he affirmed. ""Take my tip for it."" ",fiction,serious,"Corley, Lenehan, Harpist","NARRATOR:

If by ""right"" you mean using them for your own pleasure and then tossing them aside, then sure.

With a wink, Corley approached the harpist and struck up a conversation. Lenehan shook his head and continued on his way, knowing that his friend would not be deterred in his pursuit.

HARPIST: 
(smiling shyly) 
Thank you for the compliment. I'm glad my music caught your attention.

V.O. (Harpist) Wow, that was unexpected. I'm just a humble harpist, but to have someone like him compliment my music...it's surreal. I hope I can live up to his expectations. But amidst all the noise and chaos, I can't help but feel a tinge of nervousness. What if I mess up?

It wasn't just your music that caught my attention. I couldn't help but notice your beauty as well.

As the sun began to set and the city lights flickered to life, Corley and the harpist continued their conversation, lost in each other's company. Lenehan watched from a distance, knowing that his friend had once again succeeded in capturing the heart of a woman. And as they walked off into the night, the sound of the harpist's music filled the air, a perfect accompaniment to their love story.

But an olive to eat was unobtainable. He had never cared for olives, but now he craved with all his soul to feel his teeth in one.  ""Ach! But it is the Spanish olive that you eat,"" explained the head waiter, a German ""from Basel."" ""These are for oil only."" After which he disliked the olive more than ever--until that night when he saw the first eatable specimen rolling across the shiny parquet floor, propelled towards him by the careless hand of a pretty girl, who then looked up into his eyes and smiled.  He was convinced that Eve, similarly, had rolled the apple towards Adam across the emerald sward of the first garden in the world.  He slept usually like the dead. It must have been something very real that made him open his eyes and sit up in bed alertly. There was a noise against his door. He listened. The room was still quite dark. It was early morning. The noise was not repeated.  ""Who's there?"" he asked in a sleepy whisper. ""What is it?""  The noise came again. Some one was scratching on the door. No, it was somebody tapping.  ""What do you want?"" he demanded in a louder voice. ""Come in,"" he added, wondering sleepily whether he was presentable. Either the hotel was on fire or the porter was waking the wrong person for some sunrise expedition.  Nothing happened. Wide awake now, he turned the switch on, but no light flooded the room. The electricians, he remembered with a curse, were out on strike. He fumbled for the matches, and as he did so a voice in the corridor became distinctly audible. It was just outside his door.  ""Aren't you ready?"" he heard. ""You sleep for ever.""  And the voice, although never having heard it before, he could not have recognised it, belonged, he knew suddenly, to the girl who had let the olive fall. In an instant he was out of bed. He lit a candle.  ""I'm coming,"" he called softly, as he slipped rapidly into some clothes. ""I'm sorry I've kept you. I shan't be a minute.""  ""Be quick then!"" he heard, while the candle flame slowly grew, and he found his garments. Less than three minutes later he opened the door and, candle in hand, peered into the dark passage.  ""Blow it out!"" came a peremptory whisper. He obeyed, but not quick enough. A pair of red lips emerged from the shadows. There was a puff, and the candle was extinguished.

The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.

V.O. (Sherlock Holmes) ""Ah, Mr. Wilson, your tattoos and trinkets betray you. Your rough hands and working class roots are no match for my keen eye. The scent of snuff and ink fills the air, but my mind is already racing, putting the pieces together. Another mystery solved, another case closed.""

SHERLOCK HOLMES: 
(smiling) 
I begin to think, Watson, that I make a mistake in explaining. 'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,' you know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?

V.O. (Sherlock Holmes) Sherlock's quick mind works at lightning speed, analyzing every detail of Mr. Wilson's appearance. My reputation is at stake, but I cannot hide the truth. Perhaps Watson is right, my honesty may not always be the best policy. But I cannot resist the thrill of solving this mystery.

"Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter. ""I cannot see that there is anything very funny,"" cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. ""If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.""  ""No, no,"" cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. ""I really wouldn't miss your case for the world. It is most refreshingly unusual.

Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground-floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him. ""'Well,' said I, 'the gentleman at No. 4.' ""'What, the red-headed man?' ""'Yes.' ""'Oh,' said he, 'his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.' ""'Where could I find him?' ""'Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul's.' ""I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross."" ""And what did you do then?"" asked Holmes. ""I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you.""

"We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes. ""You are not very vulnerable from above,"" Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him. ""Nor from below,"" said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. ""Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!"" he remarked, looking up in surprise. ""I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!"" said Holmes severely. ""You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?""

But when he looked up again, the woman had disappeared. In her place stood an old man with rotting teeth. The man stared down, curling his lips into a lonely grimace.

You’ve written three books on symbology and—” “Do you know what time it is?” “I apologize. I have something you need to see. I can’t discuss it on the phone.”A knowing groan escaped Langdon’s lips. This had happened before. One of the perils of writing books about religious symbology was the calls from religious zealots who wanted him to confirm their latest sign from God.

"Hundreds of miles from CERN, a voice crackled through a walkie-talkie. “Okay, I’m in the hallway.” The technician monitoring the video screens pressed the button on his transmitter. “You’re looking for camera #86. It’s supposed to be at the far end.” There was a long silence on the radio. The waiting technician broke a light sweat. Finally his radio clicked. “The camera isn’t here,” the voice said. “I can see where it was mounted, though. Somebody must have removed it.” The technician exhaled heavily. “Thanks. Hold on a second, will you?” Sighing, he redirected his attention to the bank of video screens in front of him. Huge portions of the complex were open to the public, and wireless cameras had gone missing before, usually stolen by visiting pranksters looking for souvenirs. But as soon as a camera left the facility and was out of range, the signal was lost, and the screen went blank. Perplexed, the technician gazed up at the monitor. A crystal clear image was still coming from camera #86. If the camera was stolen, he wondered, why are we still getting a signal? He knew, of course, there was only one explanation. The camera was still inside the complex, and someone had simply moved it. But who? And why? He studied the monitor a long moment. Finally he picked up his walkietalkie. “Are there any closets in that stairwell? Any cupboards or dark alcoves?” The voice replying sounded confused. “No. Why?” The technician frowned. “Never mind. Thanks for your help.” He turned off his walkie-talkie and pursed his lips. Considering the small size of the video camera and the fact that it was wireless, the technician knew that camera #86 could be transmitting from just about anywhere within the heavily guarded compound—a densely packed collection of thirty-two separate buildings covering a half-mile radius. The only clue was that the camera seemed to have been placed somewhere dark. Of course, that wasn’t much help. The complex contained endless dark locations —maintenance closets, heating ducts, gardening sheds, bedroom wardrobes, even a labyrinth of underground tunnels. Camera #86 could take weeks to locate. But that’s the least of my problems, he thought. Despite the dilemma posed by the camera’s relocation, there was another far more unsettling matter at hand.

Langdon felt disconcerted. And the power of God shall unite us all. Mr. Vetra actually found a way to demonstrate that particles are connected?Conclusive evidence.

V.O. (Kohler) Kohler's words were stirring up a sense of excitement within me. The field may be small, but the answers it holds could change everything. The tension in the room only adds to the thrill, as I realize the potential impact of Leonardo's research. The Illuminati may have a hand in this, and the clash between science and religion is far from over. But I am determined to uncover the truth and push the boundaries of our understanding.

NARRATOR: 
Kohler's eyes sparkled with excitement, his passion for his research evident in every word.

KOHLER: 
Leonardo believed his research had the potential to convert millions to a more spiritual life.

NARRATOR: 
Langdon's interest was piqued. He had heard of Leonardo's work, but never fully understood its significance.

KOHLER: 
Last year he categorically proved the existence of an energy force that unites us all. He actually demonstrated that we are all physically connected...that the molecules in your body are intertwined with the molecules in mine...that there is a single force moving within all of us.

NARRATOR: 
Langdon felt disconcerted. He had always believed in the power of science, but this was something else entirely.

LANGDON: 
(skeptical) 
And the power of God shall unite us all.

NARRATOR: 
Kohler chuckled at Langdon's remark.

KOHLER: 
Mr. Vetra actually found a way to demonstrate that particles are connected?

LANGDON: 
(awestruck) 
Conclusive evidence.

NARRATOR: 
Langdon's mind was reeling with the implications of such a discovery.

NARRATOR: 
Kohler's tone turned serious as he continued.

KOHLER: 
A recent Scientific American article hailed New Physics as a surer path to God than religion itself.

NARRATOR: 
The comment hit home. Langdon suddenly found himself thinking of the antireligious Illuminati.

LANGDON: 
(reluctantly) 
If the Illuminati were indeed still active, would they have killed Leonardo to stop him from bringing his religious message to the masses?

NARRATOR: 
Langdon shook off the thought. Absurd! The Illuminati are ancient history! All academics know that!

KOHLER: 
Vetra had plenty of enemies in the scientific world.

V.O. (Kohler) ""Vetra's enemies could easily sabotage her work. I can't let that happen. This research could change everything. But the Illuminati? I never thought they would be involved. The tension in this room is suffocating. I must stay focused and find a way to protect Vetra and the truth.""

NARRATOR: 
Kohler's expression turned grim.

KOHLER: 
Many scientific purists despised him. Even here at CERN. They felt that using analytical physics to support religious principles was a treason against science.

LANGDON: 
But aren't scientists today a bit less defensive about the church?

NARRATOR: 
Kohler grunted in disgust.

KOHLER: 
Why should we be? The church may not be burning scientists at the stake anymore, but if you think they've released their reign over science, ask yourself why half the schools in your country are not allowed to teach evolution. Ask yourself why the U.S. Christian Coalition is the most influential lobby against scientific progress in the world.

NARRATOR: 
The battle between science and religion is still raging, Mr. Langdon. It has moved from the battlefields to the boardrooms, but it is still raging.

NARRATOR: 
Langdon realized Kohler was right. The clash between science and religion was still very much alive, and he had witnessed it firsthand.

LANGDON: 
(contemplative) 
But perhaps there is a way for science and religion to coexist peacefully.

V.O. (Langdon) ""Contemplating Kohler's words, I can't help but wonder if there is a peaceful coexistence between science and religion. But the Illuminati's involvement is a chilling thought. The tension in this room is a reminder of the ongoing power struggle. Maybe Leonardo's research holds the key to bridging the gap.""

NARRATOR: 
Langdon's words hung in the air, a glimmer of hope in the midst of a heated debate.

KOHLER: 
(softening his tone) 
Perhaps. But it will take great minds like Leonardo and Mr. Vetra to bridge that gap.

V.O. (Kohler) Kohler's words remind me of the great minds that have come before us. But will their brilliance be enough to save us from the darkness that threatens to consume us? The tension in this room is palpable, as we grapple with the implications of Leonardo's research. I can only hope that Langdon can help us bridge the gap and uncover the truth before it's too late.

NARRATOR: 
Langdon nodded in agreement, his mind filled with thoughts of the brilliant scientist who had tragically lost his life.

NARRATOR: 
The boardroom fell silent, the weight of Kohler's words lingering in the air. The clash between science and religion was far from over, but perhaps there was hope for a future where the two could coexist in harmony. Only time would tell.

"Not many children could say they remembered the day they met their father, but Vittoria Vetra could. She was eight years old, living where she always had, Orfanotrofio di Siena, a Catholic orphanage near Florence, deserted by parents she never knew. It was raining that day. The nuns had called for her twice to come to dinner, but as always she pretended not to hear. She lay outside in the courtyard, staring up at the raindrops . . . feeling them hit her body . . . trying to guess where one would land next. The nuns called again, threatening that pneumonia might make an insufferably headstrong child a lot less curious about nature. I can’t hear you, Vittoria thought. She was soaked to the bone when the young priest came out to get her. She didn’t know him. He was new there. Vittoria waited for him to grab her and drag her back inside. But he didn’t. Instead, to her wonder, he lay down beside her, soaking his robes in a puddle. “They say you ask a lot of questions,” the young man said. Vittoria scowled. “Are questions bad?” He laughed. “Guess they were right.” “What are you doing out here?” “Same thing you’re doing . . . wondering why raindrops fall.” “I’m not wondering why they fall! I already know!” The priest gave her an astonished look. “You do?” “Sister Francisca says raindrops are angels’ tears coming down to wash away our sins.” “Wow!” he said, sounding amazed. “So that explains it.” “No it doesn’t!” the girl fired back. “Raindrops fall because everything falls! Everything falls! Not just rain!” The priest scratched his head, looking perplexed. “You know, young lady, you’re right. Everything does fall. It must be gravity.” “It must be what?” He gave her an astonished look. “You haven’t heard of gravity?” “No.” The priest shrugged sadly. “Too bad. Gravity answers a lot of questions.” Vittoria sat up. “What’s gravity?” she demanded. “Tell me!” The priest gave her a wink. “What do you say I tell you over dinner.” The young priest was Leonardo Vetra. Although he had been an awardwinning physics student while in university, he’d heard another call and gone into the seminary. Leonardo and Vittoria became unlikely best friends in the lonely world of nuns and regulations. Vittoria made Leonardo laugh, and he took her under his wing, teaching her that beautiful things like rainbows and the rivers had many explanations.

"Phileas Fogg rightly suspected that his departure from London would create a lively sensation at the West End. The news of the bet spread through the Reform Club, and afforded an exciting topic of conversation to its members. From the club it soon got into the papers throughout England. The boasted ""tour of the world"" was talked about, disputed, argued with as much warmth as if the subject were another Alabama claim. Some took sides with Phileas Fogg, but the large majority shook their heads and declared against him; it was absurd, impossible, they declared, that the tour of the world could be made, except theoretically and on paper, in this minimum of time, and with the existing means of travelling. The Times, Standard, Morning Post, and Daily News, and twenty other highly respectable newspapers scouted Mr. Fogg's project as madness; the Daily Telegraph alone hesitatingly supported him. People in general thought him a lunatic, and blamed his Reform Club friends for having accepted a wager which betrayed the mental aberration of its proposer.  Articles no less passionate than logical appeared on the question, for geography is one of the pet subjects of the English; and the columns devoted to Phileas Fogg's venture were eagerly devoured by all classes of readers. At first some rash individuals, principally of the gentler sex, espoused his cause, which became still more popular when the Illustrated London News came out with his portrait, copied from a photograph in the Reform Club. A few readers of the Daily Telegraph even dared to say, ""Why not, after all? Stranger things have come to pass.""  At last a long article appeared, on the 7th of October, in the bulletin of the Royal Geographical Society, which treated the question from every point of view, and demonstrated the utter folly of the enterprise.  Everything, it said, was against the travellers, every obstacle imposed alike by man and by nature. A miraculous agreement of the times of departure and arrival, which was impossible, was absolutely necessary to his success. He might, perhaps, reckon on the arrival of trains at the designated hours, in Europe, where the distances were relatively moderate; but when he calculated upon crossing India in three days, and the United States in seven, could he rely beyond misgiving upon accomplishing his task?

NARRATOR: 
The news of his bet has spread like wildfire, igniting animated discussions among the members of the club. The papers are abuzz with passionate arguments about his seemingly impossible journey. Some support him, but most declare him a lunatic. Yet, despite the odds stacked against him, Fogg remains determined to prove them all wrong.

NARRATOR: 
But not everyone at the club was convinced. Some saw Fogg's bet as a source of entertainment, while others saw it as a mere folly.

The news of Fogg's bet soon spread beyond the walls of the club and into the public eye. People from all walks of life were talking about it, some in disbelief and others in awe.

NARRATOR: 
Articles, both for and against Fogg's journey, flooded the newspapers. The betting men were particularly intrigued by the idea and quickly took sides.

NARRATOR: 
But amidst the chaos and debates, there were a few who believed in Fogg and his ambitious plan.

"Presently we saw that the cavern before us opened upon a hazy void. In another moment we had emerged upon a sort of slanting gallery, that projected into a vast circular space, a huge cylindrical pit running vertically up and down. Round this pit the slanting gallery ran without any parapet or protection for a turn and a half, and then plunged high above into the rock again. Somehow it reminded me then one of those spiral turns of the railway through the Saint Gothard. It was all tremendously huge. I can scarcely hope to convey to you the Titanic proportion of all that place, the Titanic effect of it. Our eyes followed up the vast declivity of the pit wall, and overhead and far above we beheld a round opening set with faint stars, and half of the lip about it well nigh blinding with the white light of the sun. At that we cried aloud simultaneously.  ""Come on!"" I said, leading the way.  ""But there?"" said Cavor, and very carefully stepped nearer the edge of the gallery. I followed his example, and craned forward and looked down, but I was dazzled by that gleam of light above, and I could see only a bottomless darkness with spectral patches of crimson and purple floating therein. Yet if I could not see, I could hear. Out of this darkness came a sound, a sound like the angry hum one can hear if one puts one's ear outside a hive of bees, a sound out of that enormous hollow, it may be, four miles beneath our feet...  For a moment I listened, then tightened my grip on my crowbar, and led the way up the gallery.  ""This must be the shaft we looked down upon,"" said Cavor. ""Under that lid.""  ""And below there, is where we saw the lights.""  ""The lights!"" said he. ""Yes--the lights of the world that now we shall never see.""  ""We'll come back,"" I said, for now we had escaped so much I was rashly sanguine that we should recover the sphere.  His answer I did not catch.  ""Eh?"" I asked.  ""It doesn't matter,"" he answered, and we hurried on in silence.  I suppose that slanting lateral way was four or five miles long, allowing for its curvature, and it ascended at a slope that would have made it almost impossibly steep on earth, but which one strode up easily under lunar conditions. We saw only two Selenites during all that portion of our flight, and directly they became aware of us they ran headlong. ",fiction,mysterious,"Narrator, Cavor, Selenites","NARRATOR:

""There were others coming, and presently a little group of perhaps eight or ten of these exquisite creatures were about me. One of them addressed me. It came into my head, oddly enough, that my voice was too harsh and deep for them. So I shook my head, and, pointing to my ears, shook it again. He came a step forward, hesitated, and then touched my hand. Then I felt other soft little tentacles upon my back and shoulders. They wanted to make sure I was real. There was nothing in this at all alarming. Indeed, there was something in these pretty little people that inspired confidence, a graceful gentleness, a certain childlike ease. And besides, they looked so frail that I could fancy myself flinging the whole dozen of them about like nine-pins. But I made a sudden motion to warn them when I saw their little pink hands feeling at the Time Machine. Happily then, when it was not too late, I thought of a danger I had hitherto forgotten, and reaching over the bars of the machine I unscrewed the little levers that would set it in motion, and put these in my pocket. Then I turned again to see what I could do in the way of communication.  ""And then, looking more nearly into their features, I saw some further peculiarities in their Dresden china type of prettiness. Their hair, which was uniformly curly, came to a sharp end at the neck and cheek; there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the face, and their ears were singularly minute. The mouths were small, with bright red, rather thin lips, and the little chins ran to a point. The eyes were large and mild; and this may seem egotism on my part I fancied even that there was a certain lack of the interest I might have expected in them.  ""As they made no effort to communicate with me, but simply stood round me smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other, I began the conversation. I pointed to the Time Machine and to myself. Then hesitating for a moment how to express time, I pointed to the sun. At once a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and white followed my gesture, and then astonished me by imitating the sound of thunder.

(smiling) 
I was standing in my Time Machine, face to face with a group of delicate beings from the future. Despite my initial fear, they approached me fearlessly, speaking in a sweet and liquid tongue.

FRAGILE BEINGS FROM THE FUTURE: 
(cooing) 
Greetings, traveler. We mean you no harm.

NARRATOR: 
(surprised) 
Their gentle voices and curious nature put me at ease.

FRAGILE BEINGS FROM THE FUTURE: 
(laughing) 
Your voice is so deep! We have never heard such a sound before.

V.O. (Fragile Beings From The Future) Their fascination with my deep voice is endearing, but I can't help but laugh at their childlike curiosity. They have no concept of the danger they're in, reaching for my Time Machine. I must act quickly, before they accidentally cause harm to themselves or my equipment.

NARRATOR: 
(smiling) 
I could feel their soft tentacles exploring my back and shoulders, as if to make sure I was real.

FRAGILE BEINGS FROM THE FUTURE: 
(pointing) 
What is this strange machine you have brought with you?

NARRATOR: 
(explaining) 
This is my Time Machine. It allows me to travel through time.

FRAGILE BEINGS FROM THE FUTURE: 
(fascinated) 
Time? What is this concept you speak of?

V.O. (Fragile Beings From The Future) Time? What is this concept they speak of? Their childlike grace and fragility is mesmerizing. Their fascination with my voice and curiosity about me is endearing. But their lack of interest in me is amusing. I must protect my Time Machine, but I can't help but feel a sense of connection with these delicate beings.

NARRATOR: 
(pointing to the sun) 
This is the sun. It represents time passing.

FRAGILE BEINGS FROM THE FUTURE:

Thunder! We understand now. Time is like the sound of thunder.

[SFX : SOUND OF THUNDER]

NARRATOR: 
(amused) 
Their clever imitation of thunder impressed me.

[SFX : THUNDER]

FRAGILE BEINGS FROM THE FUTURE: 
(exploring) 
Your physical appearance is so different from ours. Your hair is straight and your ears are large.

NARRATOR: 
(observing) 
Their hair is uniformly curly and their ears are singularly minute.

FRAGILE BEINGS FROM THE FUTURE: 
(surprised) 
You have no hair on your face. And your mouth is so small, with bright red lips.

NARRATOR: 
(smiling) 
I couldn't help but find their fascination with my appearance amusing.

FRAGILE BEINGS FROM THE FUTURE: 
(curious) 
And what are these strange objects on your face?

V.O. (Fragile Beings From The Future) Curious, I wonder what these objects on my face are. They seem to be a part of their strange appearance. I can feel their delicate touch, and their fascination with my deep voice is intriguing. But I must act quickly to protect my Time Machine from their curious hands.

NARRATOR: 
(pointing to glasses) 
These are my glasses. They help me see better.

FRAGILE BEINGS FROM THE FUTURE: 
(interested) 
Fascinating. We have never seen anything like this before.

NARRATOR: 
(proudly) 
I was happy to share my knowledge with these fragile beings from the future. They were unlike any other creatures I had encountered before, with their delicate appearance and gentle nature. And as I continued to communicate with them, I couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder and excitement for the adventures that lay ahead in this strange and beautiful world.

It didn't actually touch, did it? It came close but there was no contact.""  ""Correct."" The expert nodded. ""The mine was twenty miles off.

You can see the situation. How can we deal with a factor like this? The perfect variable.

V.O. (Kramer) ""This is a tough one. We've exhausted all our options. But there's something about this mine that doesn't add up. I need to figure out what it is. I won't let this perfect variable defeat us. We'll find a way to outsmart it.""

GROSS: 
(stares at the board plates, tense) 
Perfect? Prediction should still be possible. A living thing still acts from necessity, the same as inanimate material.

It's a perfect defense, for them. But there still might be one answer.

V.O. (Kramer) ""Okay, so we've hit a wall. But what if...? No, it's crazy. But maybe it could work... I have to ask Gross. He's the expert. If anyone can figure this out, it's him. We have to find an answer. We have to end this war.""

V.O. (Kramer) ""Wait a minute. How are we supposed to beat this? There's no way to predict when the mine will detonate. But maybe...just maybe...the Johnson Control could be the key. If only Gross can confirm it. We have to find a way to end this war. We have to.""

KRAMER: 
The heavy cruiser that returned this week. It didn't actually touch, did it? It came close but there was no contact.

V.O. (Kramer) Kramer's mind raced as he considered the implications of their latest discovery. The heavy cruiser had come close, but made no physical contact with the mine. This new type of warfare was proving to be a formidable enemy. He couldn't help but feel the weight of the situation, as they searched for a solution.

ROCKET EXPERT: 
(nods) 
Correct. The mine was twenty miles off. The cruiser was in space-drive, moving directly toward Proxima, line-straight, using the Johnson Control, of course. It had deflected a quarter of an hour earlier for reasons unknown. Later it resumed its course. That was when they got it.

V.O. (Rocket Expert) ""Kramer's theory sounds ridiculous. I can't believe he's suggesting the mine blew up on its own. But if that's true, then we're facing a whole new level of warfare. This is insane. My expertise may be useless. We need a miracle to win this war.""

KRAMER: 
(slightly nods) 
It shifted. But not enough. The mine was coming along after it, trailing it. It's the same old story, but I wonder about the contact.

ROCKET EXPERT: 
(presents a theory) 
Here's our theory. We keep looking for contact, a trigger in the pseudopodium. But more likely we're witnessing a psychological phenomena, a decision without any physical correlative. We're watching for something that isn't there. The mine decides to blow up. It sees our ship, approaches, and then decides.

Thanks.

(serious expression) 
Well, that confirms what I'm saying. How can a ship guided by automatic relays escape a mine that decides to explode? The whole theory of mine penetration is that you must avoid tripping the trigger. But here the trigger is a state of mind in a complicated, developed life-form.

NARRATOR: 
The atmosphere in the war room was tense, as Kramer and Gross discussed their next move. The images on the board plates were still dripping, slowly hardening into place. The weight of the situation was palpable, as they faced a seemingly unbeatable enemy. But Kramer's determination and out-of-the-box thinking gave them hope.

KRAMER: 
(turns to the Rocket Expert) 
We need to find a way to defeat the enemy's living minefield. We can't keep losing ships like this.

We have to keep pushing the boundaries. There has to be a way.

ROCKET EXPERT: 
(determined) 
I won't stop until we find a solution. With my expertise in rocket technology, I know we can outsmart the enemy.

V.O. (Rocket Expert) My expertise in rocket technology is our best chance. We have to break through this perfect defense. A heavy cruiser is no match for my skills. Our enemy may seem unbeatable, but I won't stop until we find a solution. We can outsmart them, we have to.

"One day Murlock returned from gunning in a distant part of the forest to find his wife prostrate with fever, and delirious. There was no physician within miles, no neighbor; nor was she in a condition to be left, to summon help. So he set about the task of nursing her back to health, but at the end of the third day she fell into unconsciousness arid so passed away, apparently, with never a gleam of returning reason.  From what we know of a nature like his we may venture to sketch in some of the details of the outline picture drawn by my grandfather. When convinced that she was dead, Murlock had sense enough to remember that the dead must be prepared for burial. In performance of this sacred duty he blundered now and again, did certain things incorrectly, and others which he did correctly were done over and over. His occasional failures to accomplish some simple and ordinary act filled him with astonishment, like that of a drunken man who wonders at the suspension of familiar natural laws. He was surprised, too, that he did not weep--surprised and a little ashamed; surely it is unkind not to weep for the dead. ""Tomorrow,"" he said aloud, ""I shall have to make the coffin arid dig the grave; and then I shall miss her, when she is no longer in sight; but now--she is dead, of course, but it is all right--it must be all right, somehow. Things cannot be so bad as they seem.""  He stood over the body in the fading light, adjusting the hair and putting the finishing touches to the simple toilet, doing all mechanically, with soulless care. And still through his consciousness ran an undersense of conviction that all was right--that he should have her again as before, and everything explained. He had had no experience in grief; his capacity had not been enlarged by use. His heart could not contain it all, nor his imagination rightly conceive it. He did not know he was so hard struck; that knowledge would come later, and never go. Grief is an artist of powers as various as the instruments upon which he plays his dirges for the dead, evoking from some the sharpest, shrillest notes, from others the low, grave chords that throb recurrent like the slow beating of a distant drum. Some natures it startles; some it stupefies. ",horror,suspenseful,"Murlock, Murlock's wife","NARRATOR: 
Murlock stood over his wife's lifeless body, his hands trembling as he adjusted her hair and prepared her for burial. He looked at her with a mixture of disbelief and desperation, hoping that somehow, she would open her eyes and come back to him. But she remained still, her chest no longer rising and falling with breath. Murlock's mind was in turmoil, the undersense of conviction that she would return conflicting with the reality before him. He was paralyzed by grief, unable to fully comprehend the loss of his beloved wife.

MURLOCK: 
(whispering) 
No...this can't be happening. She can't be gone.

V.O. (Murlock) ""No...this can't be happening. She can't be gone."" Murlock whispered, his voice barely audible amidst the silence of the cabin. He couldn't believe she was gone, his heart aching with every breath. How could he go on without her? But he had to, for tomorrow he would have to bury her. The thought was unbearable.

NARRATOR: 
As he thought about tomorrow, the weight of his duties to make her coffin and dig her grave loomed heavily over him. But for now, he could only focus on the present, and the surreal feeling that everything was not as it seemed.

MURLOCK: 
(muttering to himself) 
This can't be real. It's just a bad dream.

V.O. (Murlock) ""This can't be real. It's just a bad dream,"" Murlock muttered to himself, desperately trying to hold on to the hope that his wife would come back to him. But as he stood over her lifeless body, he couldn't shake the feeling that this nightmare was all too real. The weight of grief and responsibility hung heavy over him, making it hard to breathe.

NARRATOR: 
But the reality of the situation was all too clear. Murlock's wife was gone, and he was left alone to deal with the aftermath.

MURLOCK: 
(voice cracking) 
What am I supposed to do now? How can I go on without her?

V.O. (Murlock) ""What am I supposed to do now? How can I go on without her?"" Murlock's voice cracked, his heart aching as he gazed at his wife's lifeless body. The thought of tomorrow, of burying her, was suffocating. But for now, he couldn't shake the feeling that this was all just a bad dream.

NARRATOR: 
He stood there in silence, his thoughts racing as he tried to come to terms with what had happened. But his mind kept going back to the same thought - that somehow, everything would be alright. That he would see her again.

MURLOCK: 
(whispering) 
It's alright...she'll come back to me. She has to.

NARRATOR: 
He looked down at her peaceful face, her features still soft and serene even in death. Murlock couldn't help but feel a sense of calm wash over him, as if she was still with him in some way. But then, reality hit him once again.

MURLOCK: 
(shaking his head) 
No, no...this isn't right. She can't be gone.

NARRATOR: 
In his grief, Murlock's mind began to play tricks on him. He could almost hear her voice, see her smile, feel her touch. But it was all just a figment of his imagination, a desperate attempt to hold onto something that was slipping away.

MURLOCK: 
(angrily) 
Why did this have to happen to us? We were happy...we were supposed to grow old together.

V.O. (Murlock) ""Why did this have to happen to us? We were happy, we were supposed to grow old together. This isn't fair. She was taken too soon. How can I go on without her? I can't even think about tomorrow, the thought of burying her is unbearable. This can't be real.""

NARRATOR: 
He fell to his knees beside her, his body racked with sobs as he mourned the loss of his wife. He couldn't imagine a life without her, and the thought of facing each day alone was unbearable.

MURLOCK: 
(voice breaking) 
I can't do this without you. Please...come back to me.

V.O. (Murlock) ""I can't believe it...my dear wife, gone forever. But maybe...just maybe, she'll come back. I can't accept that she's truly gone. How will I go on without her? I don't know if I can do this alone. Please, come back to me...I need you.""

NARRATOR: 
But she never would. Murlock's wife was gone, and he was left to pick up the pieces and carry on without her. And as he sat there, lost in his grief, he couldn't help but wonder - would he ever find a way to move on?

"Every Sunday he met in this very spot Monsieur Sauvage, a stout, jolly, little man, a draper in the Rue Notre Dame de Lorette, and also an ardent fisherman. They often spent half the day side by side, rod in hand and feet dangling over the water, and a warm friendship had sprung up between the two.  Some days they did not speak; at other times they chatted; but they understood each other perfectly without the aid of words, having similar tastes and feelings.  In the spring, about ten o'clock in the morning, when the early sun caused a light mist to float on the water and gently warmed the backs of the two enthusiastic anglers, Morissot would occasionally remark to his neighbor:  ""My, but it's pleasant here.""  To which the other would reply:  ""I can't imagine anything better!""  And these few words sufficed to make them understand and appreciate each other.  In the autumn, toward the close of day, when the setting sun shed a blood-red glow over the western sky, and the reflection of the crimson clouds tinged the whole river with red, brought a glow to the faces of the two friends, and gilded the trees, whose leaves were already turning at the first chill touch of winter, Monsieur Sauvage would sometimes smile at Morissot, and say:  ""What a glorious spectacle!""  And Morissot would answer, without taking his eyes from his float:  ""This is much better than the boulevard, isn't it?""  As soon as they recognized each other they shook hands cordially, affected at the thought of meeting under such changed circumstances.  Monsieur Sauvage, with a sigh, murmured:  ""These are sad times!""  Morissot shook his head mournfully.  ""And such weather! This is the first fine day of the year.""

Viewed from a balcony, the whole thing would doubtless have been weirdly picturesque.

The sun swung steadily up the sky, and they knew it was broad day because the color of the sea changed from slate to emerald-green, streaked with amber lights, and the foam was like tumbling snow.

""No, they don't,"" said the correspondent.  ""Well, we're not there yet, anyhow,"" said the oiler, in the stern.

Georg, who was early blinded with the blood which trickled across his eyes, stopped his struggling for a moment to listen, and then gave a short, snarling laugh.  ""So you're not killed, as you ought to be, but you're caught, anyway,"" he cried; ""caught fast. Ho, what a jest, Ulrich von Gradwitz snared in his stolen forest. There's real justice for you!""  And he laughed again, mockingly and savagely.  ""I'm caught in my own forest-land,"" retorted Ulrich. ""When my men come to release us you will wish, perhaps, that you were in a better plight than caught poaching on a neighbour's land, shame on you.""  Georg was silent for a moment; then he answered quietly:  ""Are you sure that your men will find much to release? I have men, too, in the forest to-night, close behind me, and _they_ will be here first and do the releasing. When they drag me out from under these damned branches it won't need much clumsiness on their part to roll this mass of trunk right over on the top of you. Your men will find you dead under a fallen beech tree. For form's sake I shall send my condolences to your family.""  ""It is a useful hint,"" said Ulrich fiercely. ""My men had orders to follow in ten minutes time, seven of which must have gone by already, and when they get me out--I will remember the hint. Only as you will have met your death poaching on my lands I don't think I can decently send any message of condolence to your family.""  ""Good,"" snarled Georg, ""good. We fight this quarrel out to the death, you and I and our foresters, with no cursed interlopers to come between us. Death and damnation to you, Ulrich von Gradwitz.""  ""The same to you, Georg Znaeym, forest-thief, game-snatcher.""  Both men spoke with the bitterness of possible defeat before them, for each knew that it might be long before his men would seek him out or find him; it was a bare matter of chance which party would arrive first on the scene.",drama,mysterious,"Ulrich von Gradwitz, Georg Znaeym","NARRATOR: 
The moon casts an eerie glow through the thick canopy of the stolen forest, illuminating the wreckage of broken branches and twigs scattered on the ground. The air is thick with tension, a palpable mix of relief at being alive and exasperation at their captive plight.

ULRICH VON GRADWITZ: 
(relieved) 
Thank God we're alive.

GEORG ZNAEYM: 
(snarling with anger) 
Alive? This is no victory, Ulrich. We're trapped in this cursed forest with no hope of escape.

V.O. (Georg Znaeym) Alive? Ha, what a joke. We're still in this cursed forest, at the mercy of fate. Ulrich's prayers are useless, his curses futile. We're truly alone, with only death and damnation waiting. This eerie moonlight only adds to the tension. How did we end up here?

ULRICH VON GRADWITZ: 
(pious) 
We must thank the Lord for sparing our lives.

V.O. (Ulrich Von Gradwitz) Thank the Lord? Ha! What a mockery. We should have never been here in the first place. This stolen forest, this cursed feud. And now, death and damnation await us. The moonlight may be eerie, but it's nothing compared to the darkness that consumes my soul.

GEORG ZNAEYM: 
(mocking) 
And curse Him for bringing us together once again.

ULRICH VON GRADWITZ: 
(sharp) 
Watch your tongue, Georg. You are a guest on my land, whether you like it or not.

V.O. (Ulrich Von Gradwitz) ""Watch your tongue, Georg. You are a guest on my land, whether you like it or not,"" Ulrich's voice rang out, sharp and commanding. But as he looked around at the eerie forest, his bravado faltered. What have I gotten myself into?

(cunning) 
Guest? More like prisoner. But don't worry, Ulrich. My men will be here soon to rescue me.

ULRICH VON GRADWITZ: 
(defiant) 
Your men? They won't stand a chance against my foresters.

V.O. (Ulrich Von Gradwitz) Defiant, I won't let this self-righteous fool intimidate me. My men may not be as skilled as his foresters, but they are loyal and determined. We may not make it out alive, but we won't go down without a fight. The stolen forest will be our final battleground.

GEORG ZNAEYM: 
(smug) 
We'll see about that. But if they do manage to find us, I can assure you they won't be in a hurry to save you.

V.O. (Georg Znaeym) ""Ha, they think they've got us cornered. But I know this forest better than anyone. They won't find us. And even if they do, they won't be able to save themselves, let alone me. I'll make sure of it. They'll regret crossing paths with Georg Znaeym.""

ULRICH VON GRADWITZ: 
(angry) 
You dare threaten me?

V.O. (Ulrich Von Gradwitz) ""You dare threaten me? Ha! This forest may have claimed our freedom, but I refuse to let it claim my life too. I'll fight tooth and nail until my last breath, even if it means taking you down with me. This is my destiny, not yours.""

(calm) 
I'm simply stating the facts. And when they do arrive, I'll be sure to send my condolences to your family.

ULRICH VON GRADWITZ:

How dare you speak of my death!

V.O. (Ulrich Von Gradwitz) ""How dare he taunt me with my inevitable death? This cursed forest has brought us both to the brink, yet he laughs. How long until we succumb to its grip? Will anyone come to our rescue? Or are we truly alone, at the mercy of this wicked moon and its eerie glow?""

GEORG ZNAEYM: 
(smirking) 
It's a possibility, isn't it? Caught poaching on your neighbor's land, Ulrich. Shame on you.

ULRICH VON GRADWITZ: 
(gritting his teeth) 
I will not be shamed by a thief like you.

GEORG ZNAEYM: 
(proud) 
I am no thief. This land is rightfully mine and I will do whatever it takes to protect it.

V.O. (Georg Znaeym) ""I am no thief. This land is rightfully mine and I will do whatever it takes to protect it. How dare they try to claim it for their own? I will not back down, not even in the face of death. This is my home, my legacy. I will defend it with every breath in my body.""

ULRICH VON GRADWITZ: 
(ruthless) 
Even if it means killing me?

GEORG ZNAEYM: 
(determined) 
If that's what it takes.

V.O. (Georg Znaeym) ""Of course that's what it takes. I will not let this cursed forest defeat me. I will find a way out, no matter what it takes. The moon may mock me, but I will not be broken. I will laugh in the face of death and embrace whatever fate awaits me.""

NARRATOR: 
The two men stand in silence, their hatred and rivalry filling the air. As the moon continues to cast its eerie glow, the forest seems to close in around them, trapping them in its mysterious darkness.

ULRICH VON GRADWITZ: 
(whispered) 
This forest will be the death of us both.

GEORG ZNAEYM: 
(whispered) 
Then so be it. Our quarrel will finally be settled.

As the tension builds, the smell of damp earth and the sound of rustling leaves only add to the ominous atmosphere. It's a race against time, a battle of wills in this stolen forest. Who will emerge victorious? Only time will tell.

"From the lamppost something was hanging. A shapeless dark bundle, swinging a little with the wind. Like a dummy of some sort. Loyce rolled down his window and peered out. What the hell was it? A display of some kind? Sometimes the Chamber of Commerce put up displays in the square.  Again he made a U-turn and brought his car around. He passed the park and concentrated on the dark bundle. It wasn't a dummy. And if it was a display it was a strange kind. The hackles on his neck rose and he swallowed uneasily. Sweat slid out on his face and hands.  It was a body. A human body.  ""Look at it!"" Loyce snapped. ""Come on out here!""  Don Fergusson came slowly out of the store, buttoning his pin-stripe coat with dignity. ""This is a big deal, Ed. I can't just leave the guy standing there.""  ""See it?"" Ed pointed into the gathering gloom. The lamppost jutted up against the skyâ€”the post and the bundle swinging from it. ""There it is. How the hell long has it been there?"" His voice rose excitedly. ""What's wrong with everybody? They just walk on past!""  Don Fergusson lit a cigarette slowly. ""Take it easy, old man. There must be a good reason, or it wouldn't be there.""  ""A reason! What kind of a reason?""  Fergusson shrugged. ""Like the time the Traffic Safety Council put that wrecked Buick there.

"Calixta, at home, felt no uneasiness for their safety. She sat at a side window sewing furiously on a sewing machine. She was greatly occupied and did not notice the approaching storm. But she felt very warm and often stopped to mop her face on which the perspiration gathered in beads. She unfastened her white sacque at the throat. It began to grow dark, and suddenly realizing the situation she got up hurriedly and went about closing windows and doors.  Out on the small front gallery she had hung Bobint's Sunday clothes to dry and she hastened out to gather them before the rain fell. As she stepped outside, Alce Laballire rode in at the gate. She had not seen him very often since her marriage, and never alone. She stood there with Bobint's coat in her hands, and the big rain drops began to fall. Alce rode his horse under the shelter of a side projection where the chickens had huddled and there were plows and a harrow piled up in the corner.  ""May I come and wait on your gallery till the storm is over, Calixta?"" he asked.  Come 'long in, M'sieur Alce.""  His voice and her own startled her as if from a trance, and she seized Bobint's vest. Alce, mounting to the porch, grabbed the trousers and snatched Bibi's braided jacket that was about to be carried away by a sudden gust of wind. He expressed an intention to remain outside, but it was soon apparent that he might as well have been out in the open: the water beat in upon the boards in driving sheets, and he went inside, closing the door after him. It was even necessary to put something beneath the door to keep the water out.  ""My! what a rain! It's good two years sence it rain' like that,"" exclaimed Calixta as she rolled up a piece of bagging and Alce helped her to thrust it beneath the crack.  She was a little fuller of figure than five years before when she married; but she had lost nothing of her vivacity. Her blue eyes still retained their melting quality; and her yellow hair, dishevelled by the wind and rain, kinked more stubbornly than ever about her ears and temples.  The rain beat upon the low, shingled roof with a force and clatter that threatened to break an entrance and deluge them there. They were in the dining room the sitting room the general utility room. Adjoining was her bed room, with Bibi's couch along side her own. The door stood open, and the room with its white, monumental bed, its closed shutters, looked dim and mysterious.

She knew that she would weep again when she saw the kind, tender hands folded in death; the face that had never looked save with love upon her, fixed and gray and dead. But she saw beyond that bitter moment a long procession of years to come that would belong to her absolutely. And she opened and spread her arms out to them in welcome.  There would be no one to live for during those coming years; she would live for herself. There would be no powerful will bending hers in that blind persistence with which men and women believe they have a right to impose a private will upon a fellow-creature.

""The Yanks are repairing the railroads,"" said the man, ""and are getting ready for another advance. They have reached the Owl Creek bridge, put it in order and built a stockade on the north bank.

""Only a picket post half a mile out, on the railroad, and a single sentinel at this end of the bridge.""  ""Suppose a man--a civilian and student of hanging--should elude the picket post and perhaps get the better of the sentinel,"" said Farquhar, smiling, ""what could he accomplish?""

It is now dry and would burn like tow.""  The lady had now brought the water, which the soldier drank. He thanked her ceremoniously, bowed to her husband and rode away.

"A guard came to the prison shoe-shop, where Jimmy Valentine was assiduously stitching uppers, and escorted him to the front office. There the warden handed Jimmy his pardon, which had been signed that morning by the governor. Jimmy took it in a tired kind of way. He had served nearly ten months of a four year sentence. He had expected to stay only about three months, at the longest. When a man with as many friends on the outside as Jimmy Valentine had is received in the ""stir"" it is hardly worth while to cut his hair.  ""Now, Valentine,"" said the warden, ""you'll go out in the morning. Brace up, and make a man of yourself. You're not a bad fellow at heart. Stop cracking safes, and live straight.""  ""Me?"" said Jimmy, in surprise. ""Why, I never cracked a safe in my life.""  ""Oh, no,"" laughed the warden. ""Of course not. Let's see, now. How was it you happened to get sent up on that Springfield job? Was it because you wouldn't prove an alibi for fear of compromising somebody in extremely high-toned society? Or was it simply a case of a mean old jury that had it in for you? It's always one or the other with you innocent victims.""  ""Me?"" said Jimmy, still blankly virtuous.

Unlock him at seven in the morning, and let him come to the bull-pen. Better think over my advice, Valentine.""  At a quarter past seven on the next morning Jimmy stood in the warden's outer office. He had on a suit of the villainously fitting, ready-made clothes and a pair of the stiff, squeaky shoes that the state furnishes to its discharged compulsory guests.  The clerk handed him a railroad ticket and the five-dollar bill with which the law expected him to rehabilitate himself into good citizenship and prosperity. The warden gave him a cigar, and shook hands. Valentine, 9762, was chronicled on the books, ""Pardoned by Governor,"" and Mr. James Valentine walked out into the sunshine.  Disregarding the song of the birds, the waving green trees, and the smell of the flowers, Jimmy headed straight for a restaurant. There he tasted the first sweet joys of liberty in the shape of a broiled chicken and a bottle of white wine--followed by a cigar a grade better than the one the warden had given him. From there he proceeded leisurely to the depot. He tossed a quarter into the hat of a blind man sitting by the door, and boarded his train. Three hours set him down in a little town near the state line.  ",mystery,suspenseful,"Jimmy Valentine, Warden, Clerk, Mike Dolan, Ben Price","NARRATOR: 
The guard led Jimmy Valentine through the dimly lit halls of the shoe-shop. The sound of his footsteps echoed as they walked, creating an eerie atmosphere. The smell of leather filled the air, a reminder of the prisoners' labor.

[SFX : FOOTSTEPS]

GUARD: 
Alright, Valentine. This way.

NARRATOR: 
As they approached the front office, Jimmy's heart raced with anticipation. The warden's words hung in the air, the suspense building as he handed Jimmy his pardon. The worn papers felt heavy in Jimmy's hands as he read them. The sound of the warden's laughter taunted him, the mystery of how he ended up in prison still unanswered.

WARDEN: 
Congratulations, Valentine. You're a free man.

NARRATOR: 
The warden smirked as he handed Jimmy his release papers.

JIMMY: 
(taking the papers) 
Thanks, but I don't understand. I never cracked a safe in my life.

WARDEN: 
(chuckles) 
Of course not. Let's see, now. How was it you ended up in here? Was it because you wouldn't prove an alibi for fear of compromising someone in high society? Or was it just a case of a mean old jury that had it out for you?

V.O. (Warden) Warden's inner monologue: ""Chuckles. Another guilty one. Their minds always race as they try to piece together the truth. But I hold all the answers and the power. The smell of leather, the sound of footsteps, the weight of the pardon. It's all just a game to me.""

JIMMY: 
(confused) 
I don't know what you're talking about. I've never been to Springfield.

WARDEN: 
(shrugs) 
Suit yourself. Just remember my advice, Valentine. Stop cracking safes and live a straight life.

NARRATOR: 
The warden's words hung in the air as he led Jimmy back to the shoe-shop to change into his outgoing clothes.

WARDEN: 
(calling out) 
Cronin! Take Valentine back to the shoe-shop and get him changed. Unlock him at seven in the morning and bring him to the bullpen. And, Valentine, think over my words.

NARRATOR: 
The next morning, Jimmy stood in the warden's outer office, dressed in ill-fitting, state-issued clothes. The clerk handed him a railroad ticket and a five-dollar bill.

CLERK: 
Here you go, Valentine. Good luck out there.

JIMMY: 
(taking the items) 
Thanks.

NARRATOR: 
The warden shook Jimmy's hand and handed him a cigar.

WARDEN: 
(handing him the cigar) 
Well, Valentine, looks like you're a free man. Pardoned by the governor himself.

V.O. (Warden) ""Pardoned by the governor himself. And now I'm just a free man, walking these halls like any other. But the smell of leather reminds me of my past, of the life I used to lead. Was it worth it? I guess I'll never know.""

NARRATOR: 
Jimmy smiled and walked out into the sunshine. Disregarding the beauty of nature around him, he headed straight for a restaurant.

JIMMY: 
(excited) 
Finally, some broiled chicken and white wine.

V.O. (Jimmy) Wow, finally some real food! This chicken smells amazing. And white wine too? This must be my lucky day. But why was I in prison in the first place? I need to find the truth. Maybe I can start a new life now.

NARRATOR: 
After indulging in his first meal as a free man, Jimmy leisurely made his way to the train station. He tossed a quarter into the hat of a blind man sitting by the door and boarded his train. Three hours later, he arrived in a small town near the state line.

NARRATOR: 
Jimmy Valentine, also known as Mike Dolan, walked out of the train station with a newfound sense of freedom. He had served ten months of a four-year sentence for a crime he didn't commit. But as he approached the town, a familiar face caught his eye.

MIKE: 
(excited) 
Ben Price! What are you doing here?

BEN: 
(smiling) 
Well, well, look who's here. Mike Dolan, the notorious safe-cracker.

V.O. (Ben) BEN's inner monologue: ""That's him, the man who put me here. The one who knows the truth. My heart races with anger and fear. How did he do it? The warden's mocking laughter only fuels my need for revenge. I'll make him pay for what he's done.""

NARRATOR: 
Mike laughed and shook Ben's hand.

MIKE: 
(proudly) 
Not anymore, my friend. I've been pardoned by the governor.

BEN: 
(serious) 
Good for you, Mike. But don't forget, old habits die hard.

V.O. (Ben) ```
        BEN's inner monologue: ""Mike got lucky. But I've been through enough to know that old habits are hard to break. This place reeks of suffering. I can feel the warden's amusement, but I won't rest until I unravel the truth behind my imprisonment.""

NARRATOR: 
Mike's smile faded as he thought about Ben's words. Would he really be able to turn his life around and leave his criminal ways behind?

MIKE: 
(determined) 
I have to, Ben. I have to prove my innocence and make a man of myself.

V.O. (Mike) MIKE: I have to prove my innocence, just like Jimmy. But how? The warden's laughter, the smell of leather, it's all so familiar. I can't shake this feeling that I've been here before... I have to find the truth and clear my name.

NARRATOR: 
As Mike walked away, Ben watched him, unsure if he could really leave his past behind. Only time would tell if Mike Dolan, aka Jimmy Valentine, could truly change his ways and start a new life.

"Jerton had not harboured the least intention of extending his thirst for name-labels to his neighbour. After her rather remarkable announcement, however, he was obliged to say something in the way of polite inquiry.  ""Yes,"" answered the lady, ""I suppose it is a case of partial loss of memory. I was in the train coming down here; my ticket told me that I had come from Victoria and was bound for this place. I had a couple of five-pound notes and a sovereign on me, no visiting cards or any other means of identification, and no idea as to who I am. I can only hazily recollect that I have a title; I am Lady Somebody - beyond that my mind is a blank.""  ""Hadn't you any luggage with you?"" asked Jerton.  ""That is what I didn't know. I knew the name of this hotel and made up my mind to come here, and when the hotel porter who meets the trains asked if I had any luggage I had to invent a dressing-bag and dress-basket; I could always pretend that they had gone astray. I gave him the name of Smith, and presently he emerged from a confused pile of luggage and passengers with a dressing- bag and dress-basket labelled Kestrel-Smith. I had to take them; I don't see what else I could have done.""  Jerton said nothing, but he rather wondered what the lawful owner of the baggage would do.  ""Of course it was dreadful arriving at a strange hotel with the name of Kestrel-Smith, but it would have been worse to have arrived without luggage. Anyhow, I hate causing trouble.""  Jerton had visions of harassed railway officials and distraught Kestrel-Smiths, but he made no attempt to clothe his mental picture in words. The lady continued her story.  ""Naturally, none of my keys would fit the things, but I told an intelligent page boy that I had lost my key-ring, and he had the locks forced in a twinkling. Rather too intelligent, that boy; he will probably end in Dartmoor. The Kestrel-Smith toilet tools aren't up to much, but they are better than nothing.""  ""If you feel sure that you have a title,"" said Jerton, "" why not get hold of a peerage and go right through it?""  ""I tried that. I skimmed through the list of the House of Lords in 'Whitaker,' but a mere printed string of names conveys awfully little to one, you know. If you were an army officer and had lost your identity you might pore over the Army List for months without finding out who your were. ",comedy,humorous ,"Jerton, Lady Kestrel-Smit, Page boy","NARRATOR: 
Jerton sat in the hotel room, still in disbelief at the rather peculiar situation that had been thrust upon him. He had only wanted a quiet vacation, but now he was faced with a lady claiming to have lost her memory and a fake name to boot. The room smelled of fresh linens and the gentle hum of the air conditioner filled the air. Jerton couldn't help but chuckle at the thought of the poor railway officials and distraught Kestrel-Smiths that would soon be dealing with this mess. But for now, he simply sat and listened to the lady's absurd story with a mixture of amusement and disbelief.

[SFX : CHUCKLE]

JERTON: 
(polite) 
Well, this is quite a predicament, isn't it?

JERTON: 
(skeptical) 
Of course not. But I can't help but wonder, how did you come up with the name Kestrel-Smith?

JERTON: 
(amused) 
I must say, you have quite the imagination.

JERTON: 
(curious) 
But surely, you must have some idea of who you are.

JERTON: 
(thoughtful) 
Perhaps we should consult a peerage. It might jog your memory.

V.O. (Jerton) ""A peerage? What could that possibly have to do with this bizarre situation? But then again, it wouldn't hurt to try. Who knows, maybe it'll actually jog her memory. This whole thing is just so absurd, I can't believe I'm stuck in the middle of it.""

NARRATOR: 
Jerton could see the frustration in Lady Kestrel-Smit's eyes. He couldn't help but feel sorry for her, even if she did have a knack for getting herself into strange situations.

JERTON: 
(polite) 
Well, until we can figure this out, you are welcome to stay here. I'm sure the hotel staff will be more than happy to assist you.

NARRATOR: 
Meanwhile, the page boy had been eavesdropping on their conversation. He was intrigued by the lady's story and couldn't resist asking her a few questions.

PAGE BOY: 
(curious) 
Excuse me, ma'am. But how did you lose your memory?

PAGE BOY: 
(suspicious) 
That sounds rather suspicious, ma'am.

NARRATOR: 
The page boy didn't believe her, but he was also not one to turn away from a good mystery. He decided to help her out, even if it meant bending a few rules.

PAGE BOY: 
(mischievous) 
I'll see what I can do to help you, ma'am. Maybe we can find some clues in your luggage.

V.O. (Page Boy) Wow, this lady is something else. Lost memory and a fake name? This is too good. I can't wait to see the chaos unfold. But for now, I'll play along and see what I can dig up in her luggage. This is going to be fun.

NARRATOR: 
And with that, Jerton, Lady Kestrel-Smit, and the page boy set off on a mission to uncover the truth behind her mysterious memory loss. Little did they know, this would be the beginning of a wild and comical adventure.

"""There is a wild beast in your woods,"" said the artist Cunningham, as he was being driven to the station. It was the only remark he had made during the drive, but as Van Cheele had talked incessantly his companion's silence had not been noticeable.  ""A stray fox or two and some resident weasels. Nothing more formidable,"" said Van Cheele. The artist said nothing.  ""What did you mean about a wild beast?"" said Van Cheele later, when they were on the platform.  ""Nothing. My imagination. Here is the train,"" said Cunningham.  That afternoon Van Cheele went for one of his frequent rambles through his woodland property. He had a stuffed bittern in his study, and knew the names of quite a number of wild flowers, so his aunt had possibly some justification in describing him as a great naturalist. At any rate, he was a great walker. It was his custom to take mental notes of everything he saw during his walks, not so much for the purpose of assisting contemporary science as to provide topics for conversation afterwards. When the bluebells began to show themselves in flower he made a point of informing every one of the fact; the season of the year might have warned his hearers of the likelihood of such an occurrence, but at least they felt that he was being absolutely frank with them.  What Van Cheele saw on this particular afternoon was, however, something far removed from his ordinary range of experience. On a shelf of smooth stone overhanging a deep pool in the hollow of an oak coppice a boy of about sixteen lay asprawl, drying his wet brown limbs luxuriously in the sun. His wet hair, parted by a recent dive, lay close to his head, and his light-brown eyes, so light that there was an almost tigerish gleam in them, were turned towards Van Cheele with a certain lazy watchfulness. It was an unexpected apparition, and Van Cheele found himself engaged in the novel process of thinking before he spoke. Where on earth could this wild-looking boy hail from? The miller's wife had lost a child some two months ago, supposed to have been swept away by the mill-race, but that had been a mere baby, not a half-grown lad.  ""What are you doing there?"" he demanded.  ",mystery,suspenseful,"Van Cheele, Artist Cunningham, Wild boy","NARRATOR: 
The afternoon sun shone through the rustling leaves of the oak coppice, casting dappled shadows on the forest floor. Van Cheele's footsteps were muffled by the soft carpet of moss as he made his way through the trees. Suddenly, he came upon a deep pool, its surface sparkling in the sunlight. And there, on a smooth stone shelf above the water, lay a boy of about sixteen. His brown limbs, still wet from a recent swim, glistened in the light. Van Cheele stood in awe, his eyes drawn to the boy's almost tigerish gaze. Who was this mysterious figure, and what was he doing here, in the heart of the woods? The questions raced through Van Cheele's mind as he watched the boy, his heart pounding with suspense.

[SFX : FOOTSTEPS]

VAN CHEELE: 
(whispering) 
Who are you?

WILD BOY: 
(lazily) 
Just a boy.

V.O. (Wild Boy) Just a boy. So carefree and wild, like the forest itself. He's so different from me, so free. I wish I could be like him, unencumbered by responsibilities. But then again, I have a duty to fulfill. Who knows what secrets this boy holds, and what dangers lurk in these woods.

VAN CHEELE: 
But what are you doing here?

WILD BOY: 
(smirking) 
Isn't it obvious? I'm enjoying the sun.

VAN CHEELE: 
But this is private property. How did you get here?

WILD BOY: 
(eyes narrowing) 
I live here.

ARTIST CUNNINGHAM: 
(to himself) 
Incredible.

NARRATOR: 
Van Cheele turned to see the artist Cunningham standing a few feet away, his eyes fixed on the wild boy.

VAN CHEELE: 
(surprised) 
You know this boy?

ARTIST CUNNINGHAM: 
(lost in thought) 
No, but I have a feeling I should.

V.O. (Artist Cunningham) No, I don't know why, but I feel like I should. Who is this boy? He looks so wild, so free. What secrets does he hold? I can't stop staring at him. What if he's dangerous? Should I approach him or stay hidden? My heart races with curiosity and fear.

VAN CHEELE: 
(to Wild Boy) 
What's your name?

WILD BOY: 
(smirking) 
You can call me whatever you want.

VAN CHEELE: 
(eyes widening) 
What do you mean?

WILD BOY: 
(voice dropping) 
I have many names. But you can call me the Wild Boy.

V.O. (Wild Boy) Wild Boy: I have many names, but you can call me the Wild Boy. I prefer it that way, a name that fits my untamed spirit. But who is this man, and why does he look at me with such awe and wonder? Maybe he sees the wildness in me, just like I see it in myself.

VAN CHEELE: 
(whispers) 
The Wild Boy.

NARRATOR: 
Van Cheele couldn't believe what he was hearing. The Wild Boy had been the stuff of legends in these woods, a mysterious creature that appeared and disappeared without a trace. And now, he was standing right in front of him.

VAN CHEELE: 
(excitedly) 
This is incredible. I have to tell everyone!

V.O. (Van Cheele) ""Wow, this is amazing. I can't believe what I just stumbled upon. The others have to see this. I need to tell them right away. Who is this boy? What's his story? I can't wait to find out. This is going to be the talk of the town.""

WILD BOY: 
(suddenly serious) 
No, you can't.

VAN CHEELE: 
(eyes widening) 
Why not?

V.O. (Van Cheele) ""Why not? This boy, so wild and free, embodies everything I've ever desired. But what if he's dangerous? Or worse, what if he's just a figment of my imagination? I must know, I must find out. My heart races with excitement and fear as I approach him, drawn by his mesmerizing gaze.""

WILD BOY: 
(voice dropping) 
Because I'm not supposed to be seen. I'm not supposed to exist.

V.O. (Wild Boy) ```
        Wild Boy's voice drops as he speaks, feeling the weight of his existence. Alone and unseen, he's always been a ghost in this world. But now, in the presence of this stranger, he can't help but feel a glimmer of hope. Could this be the start of something new?

VAN CHEELE: 
(confused) 
What do you mean?

WILD BOY: 
(voice trembling) 
I'm not like you. I'm not human. I'm something else.

V.O. (Wild Boy) I can feel it, the fear and uncertainty in his voice. I know I'm not like him, not human. But I am something, something wild and untamed. The sun's warmth on my skin, the rustling leaves, the earth beneath my feet, this is where I belong.

VAN CHEELE: 
(voice softening) 
I don't care what you are. You're here, and that's all that matters.

NARRATOR: 
The Wild Boy looked at Van Cheele with a mixture of fear and longing, as if he had been waiting his whole life for someone to accept him.

ARTIST CUNNINGHAM: 
(suddenly excited) 
This is perfect. I have to paint you.

V.O. (Artist Cunningham) Wow, this is perfect. The light dancing on his skin, the mystery in his eyes. I have to capture it all on canvas. The way the sun illuminates the forest, the boy's wild energy. It's all too perfect to ignore. My excitement is palpable.

WILD BOY: 
(suspicious) 
Paint me?

ARTIST CUNNINGHAM: 
(eyes shining) 
Yes, I can capture your wildness on canvas. It will be my greatest masterpiece.

V.O. (Artist Cunningham) Yes, I can capture your wildness on canvas. It will be my greatest masterpiece. His eyes shining with excitement, Cunningham's mind raced with ideas. The dappled sunlight, the boy's intense gaze, it was all so perfect. This will be my greatest challenge yet, but I am determined to capture this wildness and make it my own.

VAN CHEELE: 
(excitedly) 
Yes, let's do it!

NARRATOR: 
And so, the three of them spent the rest of the afternoon in the woods, with the artist Cunningham capturing every detail of the wild boy's essence on canvas. And as the sun started to set, the Wild Boy disappeared into the shadows, leaving Van Cheele and the artist Cunningham with a sense of wonder and mystery that they would never forget.

"Langdon strode silently behind Vittoria and Kohler as they moved back into the main atrium where Langdon’s bizarre visit had begun. Vittoria’s legs drove in fluid efficiency—like an Olympic diver—a potency, Langdon figured, no doubt born from the flexibility and control of yoga. He could hear her breathing slowly and deliberately, as if somehow trying to filter her grief. Langdon wanted to say something to her, offer his sympathy. He too had once felt the abrupt hollowness of unexpectedly losing a parent. He remembered the funeral mostly, rainy and gray. Two days after his twelfth birthday. The house was filled with gray-suited men from the office, men who squeezed his hand too hard when they shook it. They were all mumbling words like cardiac and stress. His mother joked through teary eyes that she’d always been able to follow the stock market simply by holding her husband’s hand . . . his pulse her own private ticker tape. Once, when his father was alive, Langdon had heard his mom begging his father to “stop and smell the roses.” That year, Langdon bought his father a tiny blown glass rose for Christmas. It was the most beautiful thing Langdon had ever seen . . . the way the sun caught it, throwing a rainbow of colors on the wall. “It’s lovely,” his father had said when he opened it, kissing Robert on the forehead. “Let’s find a safe spot for it.” Then his father had carefully placed the rose on a high dusty shelf in the darkest corner of the living room. A few days later, Langdon got a stool, retrieved the rose, and took it back to the store. His father never noticed it was gone. The ping of an elevator pulled Langdon back to the present. Vittoria and Kohler were in front of him, boarding the lift. Langdon hesitated outside the open doors. “Is something wrong?” Kohler asked, sounding more impatient than concerned. “Not at all,” Langdon said, forcing himself toward the cramped carriage. He only used elevators when absolutely necessary. He preferred the more open spaces of stairwells. “Dr. Vetra’s lab is subterranean,” Kohler said. Wonderful, Langdon thought as he stepped across the cleft, feeling an icy wind churn up from the depths of the shaft. The doors closed, and the car began to descend. “Six stories,” Kohler said blankly, like an analytical engine. Langdon pictured the darkness of the empty shaft below them. He tried to block it out by staring at the numbered display of changing floors.

V.O. (Maximilian Kohler) Maximilian Kohler's mind was racing as they entered the elevator. The darkness below and the suffocating feeling of being trapped only added to the suspense. He couldn't afford to waste any more time. They needed to find the antimatter before it was too late.

VITTORIA VETRA: 
(noticing Langdon's unease) 
Are you afraid of heights?

V.O. (Vittoria Vetra) Vittoria's question was odd. Why would I be afraid of heights? I'm a scientist, not a thrill seeker. But the way Langdon's hands shook, his eyes darting to the ground, I could sense his fear. I wonder what's going through his mind. Is it the memory of his father's funeral? Poor guy. I wish I could offer some comfort, but I'm struggling myself. And now we're getting into an elevator? Great. Just what I need - a confined space with a man who's afraid of heights. This is going to be a long ride.

ROBERT LANGDON: 
(slightly embarrassed) 
No, just not a fan of small spaces.

V.O. (Robert Langdon) ""Just keep it together, Robert. Don't let your fear of small spaces get the best of you. Focus on Vittoria and Kohler's pain, offer your condolences later. But for now, just breathe and try not to think about the elevator descending into the darkness. Just keep it together.""

(trying to ease the tension) 
The lab is only six stories below. We'll be there in no time.

CHARLES PRATT: 
(smiling) 
It'll be like a ride at an amusement park.

V.O. (Charles Pratt) ""I can't believe I'm feeling excited at a time like this. But maybe that's just my way of coping with everything. It's like a thrill ride, but with real stakes. I hope Vittoria and Kohler are okay. I have to stay strong for them.""

(takes a deep breath) 
Okay, let's do this.

V.O. (Bob Brownell) Alright, Bob, you got this. Just take a deep breath and focus. Remember, you've been through tough situations before. You can handle this. But damn, that elevator looks ominous. Don't let your mind wander, stay focused. You can do this.

What about?

V.O. (Maximilian Kohler) ""What about?"" Maximilian asked, his curiosity piqued. Langdon's silence was deafening, the memories of his father's funeral still fresh in his mind. Vittoria's grief was palpable, but he couldn't offer his sympathy. As they descended, the confined space made him feel suffocated. What could Kohler be thinking?

ROBERT LANGDON: 
(sighs) 
I'm not sure. He didn't give me much information over the phone.

V.O. (Robert Langdon) Robert Langdon sighed, feeling a sense of unease at the mention of the lack of information. He had a feeling that this was going to be another one of those cases where he had to piece together clues and solve a puzzle. But he couldn't let his emotions get in the way, especially with the haunting memory of his father's funeral still fresh in his mind. He watched Vittoria's graceful strides, empathizing with her struggle to contain her grief. The elevator ride only heightened his anxiety, the darkness below reminding him of the confined space and the suffocating feeling of being trapped. He couldn't afford to let his emotions get the best of him, not when there was a mystery to be solved.

CHARLES PRATT: 
(suspicious) 
Do you think it could be related to his death?

V.O. (Charles Pratt) Charles Pratt's mind raced as he tried to make sense of the situation. His suspicions were growing stronger with each passing moment. He couldn't shake the feeling that the death was somehow related. The eerie elevator ride only added to the tension, and he couldn't wait to get out of there and uncover the truth.

ROBERT LANGDON: 
(serious) 
It's possible. But we won't know until we get to the lab.

V.O. (Robert Langdon) Robert's mind raced as they descended six stories in the elevator. He couldn't shake the memory of his father's funeral, or the lingering pain of grief. Vittoria's deliberate breaths only added to the tension. He tried to remain calm, but the thought of what they might find in the lab was suffocating.

BOB BROWNELL: 
(voice trembling) 
What if it's something dangerous?

ROBERT LANGDON: 
(puts a hand on Bob's shoulder) 
Don't worry, Bob. We'll figure it out together.

(stepping out) 
This way.

(following Kohler) 
(nervous)

V.O. (Vittoria Vetra) (nervous) I can't believe this is happening. Is this really the right decision? Following Kohler into the unknown, hoping it will lead us to the answers. But what if we are wrong? What if this only brings more pain and suffering? I can't let that happen again.

Absolutely. Dr. Vetra's lab is one of the most secure facilities in the world.

But what if there's someone else down here?

He knew the pain Vittoria was feeling, but remained silent, not wanting to intrude. As they descended into the darkness, he promised himself they would find the answers and bring justice for Vittoria's father.

"The three children stared at George in the greatest surprise. George stared back at them. ""What do you mean?"" said Dick, at last. ""Kirrin Island can't belong to you. You're just boasting."" ""No, I'm not,"" said George. ""You ask Mother. If you're not going to believe what I say I won't tell you another word more. But I don't tell untruths. I think it's being a coward if you don't tell the truth— and I'm not a coward."" Julian remembered that Aunt Fanny had said that George was absolutely truthful, and he scratched his head and looked at George again. How could she be possibly telling the truth? ""Well, of course we'll believe you if you tell us the truth,"" he said. ""But it does sound a bit extraordinary, you know. Really it does. Children don't usually own islands, even funny little ones like that."" ""It isn't a funny little island,"" said George, fiercely. ""It's lovely. There are rabbits there, as tame as can be— and the big cormorants sit on the other side— and all kinds of gulls go there. The castle is wonderful too, even if it is all in ruins."" ""It sounds fine,"" said Dick. ""How does it belong to you, Georgina?"" George glared at him and didn't answer. ""Sorry,"" said Dick, hastily. ""I didn't mean to call you Georgina. I meant to call you George."" ""Go on, George— tell us how the island belongs to you,"" said Julian, slipping his arm through his sulky little cousin's. She pulled away from him at once. ""Don't do that,"" she said. ""I'm not sure that I want to make friends with you yet."" ""All right, all right,"" said Julian, losing patience. ""Be enemies or anything you like. We don't care. But we like your mother awfully, and we don't want her to think we won't make friends with you."" ""Do you like my mother?"" said George, her bright blue eyes softening a little. ""Yes— she's a dear, isn't she? Well— all right— I'll tell you how Kirrin Castle belongs to me. Come and sit down here in this corner where nobody can hear us."" They all sat down in a sandy corner of the beach. George looked across at the little island in the bay.",fiction,optimistic,"George, Dick, Julian, Aunt Fanny","NARRATOR: 
The sun shone brightly, casting a golden glow on Kirrin Island as the three children stood in awe.

GEORGE: 
(with a fierce gaze) 
This is my island. Kirrin Island belongs to me.

V.O. (George) ""Finally, this is my chance to prove myself. Kirrin Island, my island. My kingdom. No one can take it from me. I will protect it with all my might. This island holds so much potential, so many secrets waiting to be discovered. And I am the one to uncover them all.""

DICK: 
(skeptically) 
How can that be? You're just boasting.

GEORGE: 
(firmly) 
I am not. You can ask Mother. I always tell the truth.

JULIAN: 
(remembering Aunt Fanny's words) 
She does. George is absolutely truthful.

GEORGE: 
(continuing) 
I think it's being a coward if you don't tell the truth—and I'm not a coward.

V.O. (George) George's heart swelled with pride as she spoke. She was no coward, and she would never shy away from the truth. This island was hers, and she would protect it with all her might. The sun, the sea, the sand, they all belonged to her. And she would never let anyone take it away.

JULIAN: 
(reassuringly) 
We believe you, George. But it does sound a bit extraordinary.

GEORGE: 
(defensively) 
It is not. The island is beautiful, with rabbits and cormorants, and a wonderful castle in ruins.

V.O. (George) George fiercely defends her ownership of the island, but as she looks around at its beauty, she can't help but soften. The rabbits and cormorants, the ruined castle, all of it belongs to her. And now, she gets to share it with her friends. A true adventure awaits.

DICK: 
(excitedly) 
Wow, that sounds amazing!

V.O. (Dick) Wow, that sounds amazing! I can't wait to explore this island with George. The sun is shining, the sea is calm, and the castle looks like the perfect place for adventure. I'm so excited to be here and be a part of this story.

GEORGE: 
(softening) 
It is. Come, I'll tell you how it belongs to me.

V.O. (George) George's heart swells with pride as she stands on her island, the sun shining down on her and her friends. She can't help but soften at the sight of her kingdom, the rabbits and cormorants living in harmony. This is truly her home, and she can't wait to share its secrets with her friends.

JULIAN: 
(leading the way) 
Let's go sit in that corner, away from prying ears.

V.O. (Julian) ```
Julian hesitantly follows George to the corner, wondering what secrets she has to share. The sun beats down on his face, but the excitement in the air keeps him from complaining. As George begins her story, Julian can't help but feel a sense of wonder and longing for adventure.

GEORGE: 
(looking out at the island) 
I've always loved Kirrin Island. Ever since I was little, it's been my home.

V.O. (George) I never tire of this view. The island has been my refuge, my sanctuary since I was a child. I can still remember the thrill of exploring every nook and cranny, making it my own. And now, with my friends by my side, it feels even more like home.

DICK: 
(intrigued) 
But how did it become yours?

GEORGE: 
(sighing) 
My parents used to own it. They were explorers and adventurers. They discovered the island and fell in love with it. They spent years restoring the castle and making it their home.

JULIAN: 
(amazed) 
Your parents owned an island? That's incredible!

V.O. (Julian) Wow, your parents really were something special. I can't believe they owned an entire island. This place is incredible, the sun, the sea, the castle...I can feel the sense of adventure already. I wonder what other secrets this island holds. I can't wait to explore every inch of it.

GEORGE: 
(sadly) 
Yes, it was. Until they passed away. They left the island and the castle to me.

DICK: 
(understandingly) 
Oh, I'm sorry, George.

GEORGE: 
(smiling) 
It's okay. I love the island, and I know my parents would want me to keep it safe and make it my own.

JULIAN: 
(in admiration) 
You're very lucky, George.

GEORGE: 
(grateful) 
I am. And I'm glad to have friends like you to share it with.

V.O. (George) I never thought I could feel this way, but I'm grateful for my friends and this beautiful island. The sun, the sea, the animals, the ruins - they all belong to me. I am the queen of this place, and it's the greatest feeling in the world.

AUNT FANNY: 
(narrating) 
As the children bonded over George's story, a sense of adventure filled the air. They explored the island, discovering its secrets and making memories that would last a lifetime.

V.O. (Aunt Fanny) ```
AUNT FANNY: Oh, to see them making memories and exploring like that, it brings a tear to my eye. I never thought such a simple island could hold such magic. George is truly at home here, and I can't help but feel grateful for the adventure she's brought into our lives.

GEORGE: 
(looking at her new friends) 
I'm glad I told you the truth. Thank you for believing me.

DICK: 
(grinning) 
Of course, George. We wouldn't want to miss out on this adventure.

JULIAN: 
(winking) 
And who knows, maybe one day we'll be the ones who own an island.

GEORGE: 
(laughing) 
Anything is possible with friends like you.

V.O. (George) Wow, I never thought I'd find friends like Julian and Dick. They accept me for who I am, even with my tough exterior. And now standing on this island, with them by my side, I realize that anything truly is possible. I'm grateful for them, and for this moment.
