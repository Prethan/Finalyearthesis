"Outside the wall, at the part of the grounds farthest from the public road, were a horse and a light wagon, waiting.  The work of excavation was not difficult: the earth with which the grave had been loosely filled a few hours before offered little resistance and was soon thrown out. Removal of the casket from its box was less easy, but it was taken out, for it was a perquisite of Jess, who carefully unscrewed the cover and laid it aside, exposing the body in black trousers and white shirt. At that instant the air sprang to flame, a cracking shock of thunder shook the stunned world and Henry Armstrong tranquilly sat up. With inarticulate cries the men fled in terror, each in a different direction. For nothing on earth could two of them have been persuaded to return. But Jess was of another breed.  In the grey of the morning the two students, pallid and haggard from anxiety and with the terror of their adventure still beating tumultuously in their blood, met at the medical college.  'You saw it?' cried one.  'God! yes -- what are we to do?'  They went around to the rear of the building, where they saw a horse, attached to a light wagon, hitched to a gatepost near the door of the dissecting-room. Mechanically they entered the room. On a bench in the obscurity sat the negro Jess. He rose, grinning, all eyes and teeth.  'I'm waiting for my pay,' he said.  Stretched naked on a long table lay the body of Henry Armstrong, the head defiled with blood and clay from a blow with a spade.",horror,suspenseful,"Jess, Henry Armstrong, Student 1, Student 2","NARRATOR: 
The night was dark and eerie, the air thick with a sense of foreboding. Outside the walls of the medical college, a horse and a light wagon stood waiting, as if anticipating something sinister.

NARRATOR: 
Inside the dissecting room, the two students were met with a grisly sight - the body of Henry Armstrong, defiled and lifeless on the table. The room was filled with the stench of death and the sound of their own racing hearts.

NARRATOR: 
Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows - the grinning, all-seeing Jess. As the students trembled in fear, they realized they were not alone in the room.

JESS: 
(calmly) 
I'm waiting for my pay.

NARRATOR: 
The students were frozen in fear, unable to move as Jess continued his work, unscrewing the casket and exposing the body.

HENRY ARMSTRONG: 
(speaking for the first time) 
You should be afraid.

NARRATOR: 
The students were shocked to hear the dead body speak, but Jess remained unfazed.

JESS: 
(grinning) 
I'm not afraid of death. In fact, I find it quite intriguing.

NARRATOR: 
The students were terrified, but Jess's unwavering courage and strength made him a force to be reckoned with.

NARRATOR: 
The students were torn, but before they could make a decision, the room was filled with a blinding light and a deafening sound.

HENRY ARMSTRONG: 
(smiling) 
I told you, you should be afraid.

NARRATOR: 
The students were paralyzed with fear as Henry Armstrong stood before them, his body covered in blood and clay.

HENRY ARMSTRONG: 
(laughing) 
I want you to join me. Death is just the beginning.

NARRATOR: 
The students were horrified, but Jess remained calm.

JESS: 
(serious) 
We have to get out of here. Now.

NARRATOR: 
The students followed Jess's lead and ran out of the room, never looking back.

JESS: 
(grimly) 
We encountered something beyond our understanding. Something that should have stayed dead.

NARRATOR: 
The students were shaken by their encounter, but they knew they could never speak of it to anyone. They went their separate ways, but the memory of that night would haunt them forever.

"The young woman's glance fell upon them with a distant, swift disinterest; then with a lovely smile brightening her countenance and a tender pink tingeing her rounded cheeks, she held out a little gray-gloved hand. When she spoke her voice, full, sweet, and deliberate, proclaimed that its owner was accustomed to speak and be heard.  ""Well, Mr. Easton, if you will make me speak first, I suppose I must. Don't you ever recognize old friends when you meet them in the West?""  The younger man roused himself sharply at the sound of her voice, seemed to struggle with a slight embarrassment which he threw off instantly, and then clasped her fingers with his left hand.  ""It's Miss Fairchild,"" he said, with a smile. ""I'll ask you to excuse the other hand; ""it's otherwise engaged just at present.""  He slightly raised his right hand, bound at the wrist by the shining ""bracelet"" to the left one of his companion. The glad look in the girl's eyes slowly changed to a bewildered horror. The glow faded from her cheeks. Her lips parted in a vague, relaxing distress. Easton, with a little laugh, as if amused, was about to speak again when the other forestalled him. The glum-faced man had been watching the girl's countenance with veiled glances from his keen, shrewd eyes.  ""You'll excuse me for speaking, miss, but, I see you're acquainted with the marshal here. If you'll ask him to speak a word for me when we get to the pen he'll do it, and it'll make things easier for me there. He's taking me to Leavenworth prison. It's seven years for counterfeiting.""

The young woman's gaze drifted over the bustling train station with a distant, swift disinterest. Suddenly, her eyes landed on two figures standing in the crowd. Her lovely smile brightened her countenance and a tender pink tinted her rounded cheeks as she approached them. With a full, sweet, and deliberate voice, she spoke, drawing attention to her presence.

MISS FAIRCHILD: 
Well, Mr. Easton, if you will make me speak first, I suppose I must. Don't you ever recognize old friends when you meet them in the West?

The glum-faced man's expression softened at her words. He was a man who had made mistakes and was now paying the price, but there was still a glimmer of hope in his eyes as he asked for the marshal's help.

NARRATOR: 
The three of them stood in silence for a moment, the weight of the situation heavy on their minds. But amidst the chaos and uncertainty, there was a spark of something else - a connection between Miss Fairchild and Mr. Easton, and a glimmer of hope for the glum-faced man.

MISS FAIRCHILD:

(smiling) Well, I suppose we should get going. We don't want to keep the train waiting.

With a nod, they made their way towards the train, each lost in their own thoughts and emotions. But as they boarded the train, there was a sense of something new and exciting on the horizon. And perhaps, in the midst of all the chaos, there was a chance for a new beginning, for all of them.

"The children were at play in their play-ground one day, when a herald rode through the town, blowing a trumpet, and crying aloud, ""The King! the King passes by this road to-day.

He may look over the wall and see our playground; who knows? We must put it in order.""  The playground was sadly dirty, and in the corners were scraps of paper and broken toys, for these were careless children. But now, one brought a hoe, and another a rake, and a third ran to fetch the wheelbarrow from behind the garden gate. They labored hard, till at length all was clean and tidy.  ""Now it is clean!"" they said; ""but we must make it pretty, too, for kings are used to fine things; maybe he would not notice mere cleanness, for he may have it all the time.""  Then one brought sweet rushes and strewed them on the ground; and others made garlands of oak leaves and pine tassels and hung them on the walls; and the littlest one pulled marigold buds and threw them all about the playground, ""to look like gold,"" he said.  When all was done the playground was so beautiful that the children stood and looked at it, and clapped their hands with pleasure.  ""Let us keep it always like this!"" said the littlest one; and the others cried, ""Yes! yes! that is what we will do.""

"Eleven o'clock had struck some half-hour ago, and the elder Steffinks began to throw out suggestions leading up to that process which they called retiring for the night.  ""Come, Teddie, it's time you were in your little bed, you know,"" said Luke Steffink to his thirteen-year-old son.  ""That's where we all ought to be,"" said Mrs. Steffink.  ""There wouldn't be room,"" said Bertie.  The remark was considered to border on the scandalous; everybody ate raisins and almonds with the nervous industry of sheep feeding during threatening weather.  ""In Russia,"" said Horace Bordenby, who was staying in the house as a Christmas guest, ""I've read that the peasants believe that if you go into a cow-house or stable at midnight on Christmas Eve you will hear the animals talk. They're supposed to have the gift of speech at that one moment of the year.""  ""Oh, do let's  all go down to the cow-house and listen to what they've got to say!"" exclaimed Beryl, to whom anything was thrilling and amusing if you did it in a troop.  Mrs. Steffink made a laughing protest, but gave a virtual consent by saying, ""We must all wrap up well, then."" The idea seemed a scatterbrained one to her, and almost heathenish, but if afforded an opportunity for ""throwing the young people together,"" and as such she welcomed it. Mr. Horace Bordenby was a young man with quite substantial prospects, and he had danced with Beryl at a local subscription ball a sufficient number of times to warrant the authorised inquiry on the part of the neighbours whether ""there was anything in it.""

As they nervously munched on raisins and almonds, Horace Bordenby, a Christmas guest, shared a Russian peasant belief that animals could speak at midnight on Christmas Eve. Beryl, always up for an adventure, suggested they all go to the cow-house to listen. Mrs. Steffink laughed, but agreed to bundle up for the excursion. She saw it as an opportunity to bring the young people together, especially since Bordenby had been showing interest in her daughter.

There was a provoking, teasing, maddening smile upon her mouth and in her dark eyes. The would-be-rescuing knight felt the fire of his fiasco burn down to his soul. Here had been his chance, the chance that he had dreamed of; and Momus, and not Cupid, had presided over it. The satyrs in the wood were, no doubt, holding their sides in hilarious, silent laughter. There had been something like vaudeville--say Signor Givens and his funny knockabout act with the stuffed lion.  ""Is that you, Mr. Givens?"" said Josefa, in her deliberate, saccharine contralto. ""You nearly spoilt my shot when you yelled. Did you hurt your head when you fell?""  ""Oh, no,"" said Givens, quietly; ""that didn't hurt."" He stooped ignominiously and dragged his best Stetson hat from under the beast. It was crushed and wrinkled to a fine comedy effect. Then he knelt down and softly stroked the fierce, open-jawed head of the dead lion.  ""Poor old Bill!"" he exclaimed mournfully.  ""What's that?"" asked Josefa, sharply.  ""Of course you didn't know, Miss Josefa,"" said Givens, with an air of one allowing magnanimity to triumph over grief. ""Nobody can blame you. I tried to save him, but I couldn't let you know in time.""  ""Save who?""  ""Why, Bill. I've been looking for him all day. You see, he's been our camp pet for two years.

Josefa couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of the situation. She looked around the woods, imagining the satyrs holding their sides in silent laughter at the ridiculousness of it all.

[SFX : LAUGH]

JOSEFA: 
(laughing) 
There's no camp near the White Horse Crossing. How did he end up here?

NARRATOR: 
Ripley's easygoing nature and sense of humor put Josefa at ease. She couldn't help but feel a twinge of guilt for shooting their beloved camp pet.

JOSEFA: 
(apologetically) 
I'm sorry, Mr. Givens. I didn't mean to shoot Bill. I thought he was a dangerous beast.

NARRATOR: 
Ripley's words touched Josefa's heart. She couldn't help but feel a sense of admiration for the man who could forgive so easily.

JOSEFA: 
(smiling) 
Thank you, Mr. Givens. I'll make it up to Bill by giving him a proper burial.

V.O. (Josefa) ""Thank you, Mr. Givens. I'll make it up to Bill by giving him a proper burial."" Josefa thought, her smile fading as she realized the gravity of the situation. She couldn't believe she had killed their camp pet. Her heart ached with guilt and she couldn't help but wonder how she could make things right.

NARRATOR: 
As Josefa and Ripley walked back to camp, they chatted and laughed like old friends. Josefa couldn't help but feel grateful for the unexpected turn of events. What started as a failed rescue attempt turned into a newfound friendship. And as for Bill, he may have been gone, but he would never be forgotten by the campers who loved him.

"When Hughie came in he found Trevor putting the finishing touches to a wonderful life-size picture of a beggar-man. The beggar himself was standing on a raised platform in a corner of the studio. He was a wizened old man, with a face like wrinkled parchment, and a most piteous expression. Over his shoulders was flung a coarse brown cloak, all tears and tatters; his thick boots were patched and cobbled, and with one hand he leant on a rough stick, while with the other he held out his battered hat for alms.  'What an amazing model!' whispered Hughie, as he shook hands with his friend.  'An amazing model?' shouted Trevor at the top of his voice; 'I should think so! Such beggars as he are not to be met with every day. A trouvaille, mort cher; a living Velasquez! My stars! what an etching Rembrandt would have made of him!'  'Poor old chap! said Hughie, 'how miserable he looks! But I suppose, to you painters, his face is his fortune?'  'Certainly,' replied Trevor, 'you don't want a beggar to look happy, do you?'  'How much does a model get for sitting?' asked Hughie, as he found himself a comfortable seat on a divan.  'A shilling an hour.'  'And how much do you get for your picture, Alan?'  'Oh, for this I get two thousand!'  'Pounds?'  'Guineas. Painters, poets, and physicians always get guineas.'  'Well, I think the model should have a percentage,' cried Hughie, laughing; 'they work quite as hard as you do.'  'Nonsense, nonsense! Why, look at the trouble of laying on the paint alone, and standing all day long at one's easel! It's all very well, Hughie, for you to talk, but I assure you that there are moments when Art almost attains to the dignity of manual labour. But you mustn't chatter; I'm very busy. Smoke a cigarette, and keep quiet.'  After some time the servant came in, and told Trevor that the frame-maker wanted to speak to him.",comedy,humorous ,"Hughie, Trevor, Beggar-man, Servant, Frame-maker","NARRATOR: 
Hughie walked into Trevor's studio, the smell of fresh paint and cigarette smoke hitting him as he entered. He found Trevor standing on a raised platform, putting the finishing touches on a life-size picture of a beggar-man.

HUGHIE: 
(excitedly) 
What an amazing model!

TREVOR: 
(shouts) 
I should think so! Such beggars are not to be met with every day. A trouvaille, mort cher; a living Velasquez! My stars! What an etching Rembrandt would have made of him!

V.O. (Trevor) TREVOR's inner monologue:

""Ah, finally someone who appreciates my work. This beggar is a masterpiece, a true gem. I can already see the fame and fortune this painting will bring me. But I must focus, there's still so much to do. The frame-maker can wait, my art comes first.""

HUGHIE: 
(sympathetically) 
Poor old chap! How miserable he looks! But I suppose, to you painters, his face is his fortune?

TREVOR: 
(smugly) 
Certainly. You don't want a beggar to look happy, do you?

HUGHIE: 
(curious) 
How much does a model get for sitting?

V.O. (Hughie) Hughie's curiosity was piqued as he took in the scene before him. The old beggar-man was an amazing model, but Hughie couldn't help but feel sorry for him. He wondered how much the man was paid for sitting, and was surprised to learn it was only a shilling an hour. He couldn't help but think the model deserved more for his hard work.

TREVOR: 
(proudly) 
A shilling an hour.

HUGHIE: 
(surprised) 
And how much do you get for your picture, Alan?

TREVOR: 
(confidently) 
Oh, for this I get two thousand!

HUGHIE: 
(amazed) 
Pounds?

TREVOR: 
(correcting) 
Guineas. Painters, poets, and physicians always get guineas.

V.O. (Trevor) ```
Trevor thought to himself, ""Two thousand guineas for this painting? That's more than I could have ever imagined. But is it worth exploiting the misery of this poor old man? Perhaps Hughie is right, he deserves a percentage. But then again, this is just the reality of being an artist.""

HUGHIE: 
(jokingly) 
Well, I think the model should have a percentage. They work just as hard as you do.

TREVOR: 
(dismissively) 
Nonsense, nonsense! Why, look at the trouble of laying on the paint alone, and standing all day long at one's easel! It's all very well, Hughie, for you to talk, but I assure you that there are moments when Art almost attains to the dignity of manual labour. But you mustn't chatter; I'm very busy. Smoke a cigarette, and keep quiet.

[SFX : CHATTER]

NARRATOR: 
As they continued to chat, the servant interrupted to inform Trevor that the frame-maker needed to speak to him. Trevor excused himself and went to speak with the frame-maker.

SERVANT: 
(politely) 
Excuse me, sir. The frame-maker is here to see you.

TREVOR: 
(annoyed) 
Can't you see I'm busy? Tell him to come back later.

SERVANT: 
(apologetically) 
I'm sorry, sir. He said it's urgent.

TREVOR: 
(irritated) 
Fine. Show him in.

NARRATOR: 
The frame-maker entered the studio, carrying a large frame.

TREVOR: 
(impressed) 
Let me see.

NARRATOR: 
Trevor examined the frame and was pleased with the result.

TREVOR: 
(gratefully) 
It's perfect. Thank you, my friend.

NARRATOR: 
Trevor paid the frame-maker handsomely for his work, and the two men bid farewell.

TREVOR: 
(to Hughie) 
Well, my friend, it's time to unveil my masterpiece to the world. Are you ready?

V.O. (Trevor) ""This is it, my moment to shine. My masterpiece will finally be revealed to the world. I can feel the excitement bubbling inside me. Hughie's admiration only fuels my confidence. I can't wait to see the reactions of my peers. This is my time to make a name for myself.""

HUGHIE: 
(excitedly) 
Absolutely!

NARRATOR: 
Trevor unveiled the painting, and Hughie was amazed by its beauty.

HUGHIE: 
(astonished) 
It's breathtaking, Trevor! You truly are a master of your craft.

V.O. (Hughie) Hughie was astonished by Trevor's masterpiece. He couldn't believe how lifelike the beggar-man looked. But as he watched Trevor work, he couldn't help but feel sorry for the model. Trevor's words about the value of a miserable face made him question the true worth of art.

TREVOR: 
(grinning) 
Thank you, Hughie. And thank you for being such a good friend and model.

HUGHIE: 
(jokingly) 
I think I deserve a percentage for inspiring such a masterpiece.

V.O. (Hughie) Hughie couldn't help but feel a twinge of jealousy as he watched Trevor put the finishing touches on his masterpiece. He knew he had inspired the painting, but was he really not entitled to any credit? Perhaps he should have asked for a percentage, but it was too late now. He couldn't help but feel a bit foolish for even joking about it.

TREVOR: 
(laughing) 
You'll get your share of the fame and fortune, my friend.

NARRATOR: 
And with that, the two friends laughed and celebrated the success of Trevor's painting, with the beggar-man's piteous expression forever immortalized on canvas.

"He seemed unwilling to leave anything to the imagination of a casual observer, and his talk grew presently personal and introspective.  ""I don't know how it is,"" he told his friend, ""I'm not much over forty, but I seem to have settled down into a deep groove of elderly middle-age. My sister shows the same tendency. We like everything to be exactly in its accustomed place; we like things to happen exactly at their appointed times; we like everything to be usual, orderly, punctual, methodical, to a hair's breadth, to a minute. It distresses and upsets us if it is not so. For instance, to take a very trifling matter, a thrush has built its nest year after year in the catkin- tree on the lawn; this year, for no obvious reason, it is building in the ivy on the garden wall. We have said very little about it, but I think we both feel that the change is unnecessary, and just a little irritating.""  ""Perhaps,"" said the friend, ""it is a different thrush.""  ""We have suspected that,"" said J. P. Huddle, ""and I think it gives us even more cause for annoyance. We don't feel that we want a change of thrush at our time of life; and yet, as I have said, we have scarcely reached an age when these things should make themselves seriously felt.""  ""What you want,"" said the friend, ""is an Unrest-cure.""  ""An Unrest-cure? I've never heard of such a thing.""  ""You've heard of Rest-cures for people who've broken down under stress of too much worry and strenuous living; well, you're suffering from overmuch repose and placidity, and you need the opposite kind of treatment.""  ""But where would one go for such a thing?""  ""Well, you might stand as an Orange candidate for Kilkenny, or do a course of district visiting in one of the Apache quarters of Paris, or give lectures in Berlin to prove that most of Wagner's music was written by Gambetta; and there's always the interior of Morocco to travel in. But, to be really effective, the Unrest-cure ought to be tried in the home. How you would do it I haven't the faintest idea.""",comedy,humorous ,"J. P. Huddle, Friend","NARRATOR: 
J.P. Huddle and his friend sit on the plush couch, sipping their tea and discussing the mundane details of their lives.

I've noticed that about you both. You like everything to be exactly in its accustomed place.

I can see that. You like everything to be usual, orderly, punctual, methodical, to a hair's breadth, to a minute.

FRIEND: 
Even something as small as a thrush building its nest in a different spot?

FRIEND: 
Perhaps it's a different thrush.

FRIEND: 
What you need is an Unrest-cure.

FRIEND: 
It's like a Rest-cure for people who've broken down under stress, but for you, it's the opposite. You need a change of pace.

FRIEND: 
Well, you could stand as an Orange candidate for Kilkenny, or do a course of district visiting in one of the Apache quarters of Paris.

FRIEND: 
Or you could give lectures in Berlin to prove that most of Wagner's music was written by Gambetta.

Suddenly, J.P. Huddle's sister bursts into the room, her hair disheveled and her face flushed with excitement.

"Filled with amazement and terror by this apparition of a horseman in the sky--half believing himself the chosen scribe of some new Apocalypse, the officer was overcome by the intensity of his emotions; his legs failed him and he fell. Almost at the same instant he heard a crashing sound in the trees--a sound that died without an echo--and all was still.  The officer rose to his feet, trembling. The familiar sensation of an abraded shin recalled his dazed faculties. Pulling himself together he ran rapidly obliquely away from the cliff to a point distant from its foot; thereabout he expected to find his man; and thereabout he naturally failed. In the fleeting instant of his vision his imagination had been so wrought upon by the apparent grace and ease and intention of the marvelous performance that it did not occur to him that the line of march of arial cavalry is directly downward, and that he could find the objects of his search at the very foot of the cliff. A half-hour later he returned to camp.  This officer was a wise man; he knew better than to tell an incredible truth. He said nothing of what he had seen. But when the commander asked him if in his scout he had learned anything of advantage to the expedition he answered:  ""Yes, sir; there is no road leading down into this valley from the southward.""  The commander, knowing better, smiled.  After firing his shot, Private Carter Druse reloaded his rifle and resumed his watch. Ten minutes had hardly passed when a Federal sergeant crept cautiously to him on hands and knees. Druse neither turned his head nor looked at him, but lay without motion or sign of recognition.  ""Did you fire?"" the sergeant whispered.  ""Yes.""  ""At what?""  ""A horse. It was standing on yonder rock--pretty far out. You see it is no longer there. It went over the cliff.""  The man's face was white, but he showed no other sign of emotion. Having answered, he turned away his eyes and said no more. The sergeant did not understand.  ""See here, Druse,"" he said, after a moment's silence, ""it's no use making a mystery. I order you to report. Was there anybody on the horse?""  ""Yes.""  ""Well?""  ""My father.""

The officer stands in the darkness of the camp, his mind racing with fear and awe. The image of the horseman in the sky still haunts him, his heart pounding with terror. He can still hear the sound of the horse crashing through the trees, the silence that followed only adding to the eerie atmosphere. His legs shake as he recalls the sensation of falling, his shin throbbing with pain. He knows he must find his man, but his imagination is still consumed by the graceful and intentional movements of the arial cavalry.

And as for Private Druse, he is left to grapple with the weight of his actions and the realization that war can tear even the closest of families apart.

"That night the city wore the mask of a capital. The five young men strolled along Stephen's Green in a faint cloud of aromatic smoke. They talked loudly and gaily and their cloaks dangled from their shoulders. The people made way for them. At the corner of Grafton Street a short fat man was putting two handsome ladies on a car in charge of another fat man. The car drove off and the short fat man caught sight of the party.  ""Andre.""  ""It's Farley!""  A torrent of talk followed. Farley was an American. No one knew very well what the talk was about. Villona and Riviere were the noisiest, but all the men were excited. They got up on a car, squeezing themselves together amid much laughter. They drove by the crowd, blended now into soft colours, to a music of merry bells. They took the train at Westland Row and in a few seconds, as it seemed to Jimmy, they were walking out of Kingstown Station. The ticket-collector saluted Jimmy; he was an old man:  ""Fine night, sir!""  It was a serene summer night; the harbour lay like a darkened mirror at their feet. They proceeded towards it with linked arms, singing Cadet Roussel in chorus, stamping their feet at every:  ""Ho! Ho! Hohe, vraiment!""  They got into a rowboat at the slip and made out for the American's yacht. There was to be supper, music, cards. Villona said with conviction:  ""It is delightful!""  There was a yacht piano in the cabin. Villona played a waltz for Farley and Riviere, Farley acting as cavalier and Riviere as lady. Then an impromptu square dance, the men devising original figures. What merriment! Jimmy took his part with a will; this was seeing life, at least. Then Farley got out of breath and cried ""Stop!"" A man brought in a light supper, and the young men sat down to it for form's sake. They drank, however: it was Bohemian. They drank Ireland, England, France, Hungary, the United States of America. Jimmy made a speech, a long speech, Villona saying: ""Hear! hear!"" whenever there was a pause. There was a great clapping of hands when he sat down. It must have been a good speech. Farley clapped him on the back and laughed loudly. What jovial fellows! What good company they were!",fiction,optimistic,"Five young men, Farley, Villona, Riviere, Jimmy","NARRATOR:

The man wore motley. He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him that I thought I should never have done wringing his hand.  I said to him --""My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met. How remarkably well you are looking to-day.

""I have my doubts,"" I replied; ""and I was silly enough to pay the full Amontillado price without consulting you in the matter. You were not to be found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.""

"The Skin Horse had lived longer in the nursery than any of the others. He was so old that his brown coat was bald in patches and showed the seams underneath, and most of the hairs in his tail had been pulled out to string bead necklaces. He was wise, for he had seen a long succession of mechanical toys arrive to boast and swagger, and by-and-by break their mainsprings and pass away, and he knew that they were only toys, and would never turn into anything else. For nursery magic is very strange and wonderful, and only those playthings that are old and wise and experienced like the Skin Horse understand all about it.  ""What is REAL?"" asked the Rabbit one day, when they were lying side by side near the nursery fender, before Nana came to tidy the room. ""Does it mean having things that buzz inside you and a stick-out handle?""  ""Real isn't how you are made,"" said the Skin Horse. ""It's a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real.""  ""Does it hurt?"" asked the Rabbit.  ""Sometimes,"" said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful. ""When you are Real you don't mind being hurt.""  ""Does it happen all at once, like being wound up,"" he asked, ""or bit by bit?""  ""It doesn't happen all at once,"" said the Skin Horse. ""You become. It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand.""  ""I suppose you are Real?"" said the Rabbit. And then he wished he had not said it, for he thought the Skin Horse might be sensitive. But the Skin Horse only smiled.",fiction,optimistic,"Skin Horse, Rabbit, Nana","SKIN HORSE: 
(smiling) 
Being Real is not about how you look, Rabbit. It's about how you feel inside.

RABBIT: 
(curious) 
But how do you become Real?

SKIN HORSE: 
(serious) 
It's a process, my dear. It takes time and love.

V.O. (Skin Horse) It's true, I've seen so many toys come and go, thinking they were better than the rest. But they never understood the true magic of the nursery. It takes time and love to become Real, to truly be beautiful. And I, the Skin Horse, am proof of that.

NARRATOR: 
The Skin Horse looked at the Rabbit with kind eyes, remembering his own journey to becoming Real.

SKIN HORSE: 
(continuing) 
When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real.

RABBIT: 
(excited) 
I want to become Real too!

SKIN HORSE: 
(wise) 
It will happen, Rabbit. Just be patient and let the magic of the nursery do its work.

NARRATOR: 
The Skin Horse and the Rabbit lay side by side, watching the flickering flames in the fireplace. The Skin Horse's voice was soft and comforting as he continued to explain the process of becoming Real.

[SFX : FLICKERING FLAMES]

SKIN HORSE: 
(slowly) 
It doesn't happen all at once, like being wound up. It takes time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept.

NARRATOR: 
The Rabbit listened intently, his button eyes wide with wonder.

RABBIT: 
(thoughtfully) 
So, it's like growing up?

SKIN HORSE: 
(nodding) 
Yes, in a way. But it's more than just growing up. It's about learning to love and be loved in return.

V.O. (Skin Horse) Yes, in a way. But it's more than just growing up. It's about learning to love and be loved in return. The Skin Horse thought to himself, remembering all the broken toys that had come and gone. But he knew that being Real was worth it - it was the ultimate form of nursery magic.

NARRATOR: 
The Rabbit pondered this for a moment before asking another question.

RABBIT: 
(curious) 
Does it hurt?

SKIN HORSE: 
(truthful) 
Sometimes. When you are Real, you don't mind being hurt.

NARRATOR: 
The Rabbit looked at the Skin Horse, admiring his wisdom and strength.

RABBIT: 
(whispering) 
I want to be Real like you, Skin Horse.

SKIN HORSE: 
(smiling) 
And you will be, my dear Rabbit. Just keep loving and being loved, and one day, you will become Real too.

V.O. (Skin Horse) I've seen so many toys come and go, thinking they were better than the rest. But they never understood the true magic of the nursery. It takes time to become Real, but once you do, you'll be truly beautiful. Just keep loving and being loved, dear Rabbit.

NARRATOR: 
The two toys fell silent, lost in their own thoughts. But the Skin Horse's words stayed with the Rabbit, filling him with hope and excitement for the future.

NANA: 
(entering the room) 
Time for bed, my little ones.

NARRATOR: 
Nana's gentle voice broke the silence, and the Rabbit and the Skin Horse looked up at her with grateful smiles.

SKIN HORSE: 
(grateful) 
Thank you, Nana. Goodnight, Rabbit.

RABBIT: 
(excited) 
Goodnight, Skin Horse. I can't wait to become Real!

NARRATOR: 
As Nana tucked them into bed, the Rabbit and the Skin Horse drifted off to sleep, dreaming of the day when they would both become Real. For in the magical world of the nursery, anything is possible, and love is the key to becoming truly alive.

"I walked and walked along the cold wet sand, making my chattering teeth warble in honour of cold and hunger, when suddenly, as I was carefully searching for something to eat behind one of the empty crates, I perceived behind it, crouching on the ground, a figure in woman's clothes dank with the rain and clinging fast to her stooping shoulders. Standing over her, I watched to see what she was doing. It appeared that she was digging a trench in the sand with her hands--digging away under one of the crates.  ""Why are you doing that?"" I asked, crouching down on my heels quite close to her.  She gave a little scream and was quickly on her legs again. Now that she stood there staring at me, with her wide-open grey eyes full of terror, I perceived that it was a girl of my own age, with a very pleasant face embellished unfortunately by three large blue marks. This spoilt her, although these blue marks had been distributed with a remarkable sense of proportion, one at a time, and all were of equal size--two under the eyes, and one a little bigger on the forehead just over the bridge of the nose. This symmetry was evidently the work of an artist well inured to the business of spoiling the human physiognomy.  The girl looked at me, and the terror in her eyes gradually died out... She shook the sand from her hands, adjusted her cotton head-gear, cowered down, and said:  ""I suppose you too want something to eat? Dig away then! My hands are tired. Over there""--she nodded her head in the direction of a booth--""there is bread for certain ... and sausages too... That booth is still carrying on business.""  I began to dig. She, after waiting a little and looking at me, sat down beside me and began to help me.  We worked in silence. I cannot say now whether I thought at that moment of the criminal code, of morality, of proprietorship, and all the other things about which, in the opinion of many experienced persons, one ought to think every moment of one's life. Wishing to keep as close to the truth as possible, I must confess that apparently I was so deeply engaged in digging under the crate that I completely forgot about everything else except this one thing: What could be inside that crate?  The evening drew on. ",fiction,mysterious,"Narrator, Girl","NARRATOR:

"This did not long sustain his drooping spirit. He was mentally adrift upon the Hints and Helps to Young Men in Business and Social Relations, which had suggested to him his present enterprise, when the appearance of a second youth, taller and broader than himself, with a shock of light curling hair and a crop of freckles that advertised a rich soil threw him a lifeline. He put his thumbs to his lips and whistled in a peculiarly ear-splitting way. The two boys had sat on the same bench at Sunday-school not three hours before; yet what a change had come over the world for one of them since then!  ""Hello! Where you goin', Ab?"" asked the newcomer, gruffly.  ""Callin',"" replied the boy in the collar, laconically, but with carefully averted gaze.  ""On the girls?"" inquired the other, awestruck. In Mount Pisgah you saw the girls home from night church, socials, or parties; you could hang over the gate; and you might walk with a girl in the cemetery of a Sunday afternoon; but to ring a front-door bell and ask for Miss Heart's Desire one must have been in long trousers at least three years”and the two boys confronted in the dusty road had worn these dignifying garments barely six months.

Ross and Champe were neighbors, comrades in all sorts of mischief; he was in doubt whether to halt Abner and pummel him, or propose to enlist under his banner.  ""Do you reckon you could?"" he debated, trotting along by the irresponsive Jilton boy.  ""Run home to your mother,"" growled the originator of the plan, savagely. ""You ain't old enough to call on girls; anybody can see that; but I am, and I'm going to call on Champe Claiborne.""  Again the name acted as a spur on Ross. ""With your collar and boots all dirty?"" he jeered. ""They won't know you're callin'.""  The boy in the road stopped short in his dusty tracks. He was an intense creature, and he whitened at the tragic insinuation, longing for the wholesome stay and companionship of freckle-faced Ross. ""I put the dirt on o' purpose so's to look kind of careless,"" he half whispered, in an agony of doubt.

        That's good, Sue. She's lucky to have a friend like you. (Nods) But what about me? I've been here for years, painting these walls, and no one even notices. (Sighs) I wish I had someone like you, someone who cares. (Looks at Johnsy) Maybe I can be that friend for her.

SUE: 
(smiling) 
Thanks, Behrman. I appreciate your support.

BEHRMAN: 
(serious) 
I'll do whatever I can to help too. I may be a grumpy old artist, but I care about Johnsy.

V.O. (Behrman) I'll do whatever I can to help too. I may be a grumpy old artist, but I care about Johnsy. She's like a daughter to me. I can't bear to see her like this. I'll do anything to make her better. Anything.

NARRATOR: 
And so, Sue, Behrman, and the doctor all worked together to keep Johnsy's spirits up. They talked about art, fashion, and anything else to distract her from her illness. And slowly, but surely, Johnsy's condition began to improve. One day, she even asked Sue to help her paint the Bay of Naples.

JOHNSY: 
(excitedly) 
Sue, I want to paint it. I really do.

SUE: 
(tearfully) 
I'm so proud of you, Johnsy. Let's do it.

NARRATOR: 
And so, with Sue's help, Johnsy painted the Bay of Naples. It wasn't perfect, but it was a symbol of her will to live and her determination to overcome Mr. Pneumonia. And as she continued to get better, her painting skills improved as well. She even sold her painting to a magazine, with Sue's story as the inspiration. And from that day on, Johnsy was known as a survivor, a fighter, and a talented artist. And Mr. Pneumonia was no match for her strength and determination.

"Every Sunday he met in this very spot Monsieur Sauvage, a stout, jolly, little man, a draper in the Rue Notre Dame de Lorette, and also an ardent fisherman. They often spent half the day side by side, rod in hand and feet dangling over the water, and a warm friendship had sprung up between the two.  Some days they did not speak; at other times they chatted; but they understood each other perfectly without the aid of words, having similar tastes and feelings.  In the spring, about ten o'clock in the morning, when the early sun caused a light mist to float on the water and gently warmed the backs of the two enthusiastic anglers, Morissot would occasionally remark to his neighbor:  ""My, but it's pleasant here.""  To which the other would reply:  ""I can't imagine anything better!""  And these few words sufficed to make them understand and appreciate each other.  In the autumn, toward the close of day, when the setting sun shed a blood-red glow over the western sky, and the reflection of the crimson clouds tinged the whole river with red, brought a glow to the faces of the two friends, and gilded the trees, whose leaves were already turning at the first chill touch of winter, Monsieur Sauvage would sometimes smile at Morissot, and say:  ""What a glorious spectacle!""  And Morissot would answer, without taking his eyes from his float:  ""This is much better than the boulevard, isn't it?""  As soon as they recognized each other they shook hands cordially, affected at the thought of meeting under such changed circumstances.  Monsieur Sauvage, with a sigh, murmured:  ""These are sad times!""  Morissot shook his head mournfully.  ""And such weather! This is the first fine day of the year.""  The sky was, in fact, of a bright, cloudless blue.  They walked along, side by side, reflective and sad.  ""And to think of the fishing!"" said Morissot. ""What good times we used to have!""  ""When shall we be able to fish again?"" asked Monsieur Sauvage.  They entered a small cafe and took an absinthe together, then resumed their walk along the pavement.  Morissot stopped suddenly.  ""Shall we have another absinthe?"" he said.  ""If you like,"" agreed Monsieur Sauvage.  And they entered another wine shop.  They were quite unsteady when they came out, owing to the effect of the alcohol on their empty stomachs. ",drama,serious,"Monsieur Sauvage, Morissot, Colonel Dumoulin","NARRATOR:

Monsieur Sauvage and Morissot had formed a strong friendship over their shared love for fishing. They often spent hours side by side, enjoying the peacefulness of the water and the warmth of the sun.

We don't even need to speak to understand each other, do we?

MORISSOT: 
(shakes head) 
No, we don't. Our love for fishing and nature binds us together.

In the spring, the early morning mist and gentle warmth of the sun made for a pleasant atmosphere.

Ah, the fresh air, the sound of the water... It's like therapy for the soul. Taking a deep breath, I can feel all my worries and troubles melt away. This is where I truly belong, in nature, with my dear friend Morissot. But as we walk, I can't help but feel a twinge of sadness, knowing that our fishing days may be coming to an end.

MORISSOT: 
(smiling) 
I couldn't agree more.

NARRATOR: 
But as the autumn approached, the two friends couldn't help but feel reflective and sad.

MONSIEUR SAUVAGE: 
(looking at the setting sun) 
What a glorious spectacle.

V.O. (Monsieur Sauvage) ""What a glorious spectacle,"" Monsieur Sauvage thought to himself as he gazed at the setting sun. Memories of fishing with Morissot flooded his mind, making him feel both nostalgic and melancholic. How he longed for the days when they could fish together again, just like old times.

MORISSOT: 
(nods) 
Yes, but it also reminds me that winter is coming. And with it, the end of our fishing season.

NARRATOR: 
Despite the changing seasons, their friendship remained constant. But the world around them was changing, and they couldn't ignore it.

V.O. (Colonel Dumoulin) Colonel Dumoulin sighed as he watched the two men sitting by the riverbank. He couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness as he remembered the days when he could fish with his friends. The warm sun and peaceful atmosphere only made him long for those times even more. These are truly sad times.

MORISSOT: 
(nods) 
Yes, and such weather. This is the first fine day of the year.

"There is a great deal to recommend a plains journey at first. Later, there is nothing at all to recommend it. It has the same monotony as a voyage at sea, only there is less living room, and, instead of being carried, you must progress to a great extent by your own volition. Also the food is coarse, the water poor, and you cannot bathe. To a plainsman, or a man who has the instinct, these things are as nothing in comparison with the charm of the outdoor life, and the pleasing tingling of adventure. But woman is a creature wedded to comfort. She also has a strange instinctive desire to be entirely alone every once in a while, probably because her experiences, while not less numerous than man's, are mainly psychical, and she needs occasionally time to get ""thought up to date."" So Miss Caldwell began to get very impatient.  The afternoon of the sixth day Alfred, Miss Caldwell, and Allen rode along side by side. Alfred was telling a self-effacing story of adventure, and Miss Caldwell was listening carelessly because she had nothing else to do. Allen chaffed lazily when the fancy took him.  ""I happened to have a limb broken at the time,"" Alfred was observing, parenthetically, in his soft tones, ""and so----""  ""What kind of a limb?"" asked the young Easterner, with direct brutality. He glanced with a half-humourous aside at the girl, to whom the little man had been mainly addressing himself.  Alfred hesitated, blushed, lost the thread of his tale, and finally in great confusion reined back his horse by the harsh Spanish bit. He fell to the rear of the little wagon-train, where he hung his head, and went hot and cold by turns in thinking of such an indiscretion before a lady.  The young Easterner spurred up on the right of the girl's mount.  ""He's the queerest little fellow I ever saw!"" he observed, with a laugh. ""Sorry to spoil his story. Was it a good one?""  ""It might have been if you hadn't spoiled it,"" answered the girl, flicking her horse's ears mischievously. The animal danced. ""What did you do it for?""  ""Oh, just to see him squirm. He'll think about that all the rest of the afternoon, and will hardly dare look you in the face next time you meet.""  ""I know. Isn't he funny? The other morning he came around the corner of the wagon and caught me with my hair down. I wish you could have seen him!""  She laughed gayly at the memory.  ",drama,serious,"Alfred, Miss Caldwell, Allen","NARRATOR: 
The sun beat down mercilessly on the endless expanse of the plains, casting a golden hue over the dry grass and parched earth. The air was thick with dust, kicked up by the hooves of the horses and the wheels of the wagon-train. The only sounds were the steady clip-clop of the horses' hooves and the occasional chatter of the travelers. The heat was oppressive, the monotony suffocating. Miss Caldwell longed for the comfort of her home, but she knew she must endure this journey for the sake of adventure. Alfred's story had been interrupted, but the tension between him and the young Easterner lingered, adding a layer of unease to the already stifling atmosphere.

ALFRED: 
(continuing his story) 
I happened to have a limb broken at the time, and so----

YOUNG EASTERNER: 
(looking at Miss Caldwell) 
What kind of limb?

ALFRED: 
(embarrassed) 
Well, it was my arm, actually.

MISS CALDWELL: 
(teasing) 
Oh, how brave of you, Alfred.

ALFRED: 
(defensively) 
It was a serious injury, Miss Caldwell. I could have lost my arm.

YOUNG EASTERNER: 
(laughing) 
I'm sure it was a valiant battle.

V.O. (Young Easterner) ```
I can't believe he's laughing. Does he not see the exhaustion and discomfort we're all feeling? But I suppose he's used to this heat and monotony. I, on the other hand, am not. I miss home, but I must endure for adventure's sake. Alfred's story better be worth it.

MISS CALDWELL: 
(smirking) 
It's not easy to break a limb while sitting in a wagon.

ALFRED: 
(annoyed) 
I was thrown from my horse, if you must know.

YOUNG EASTERNER: 
(mockingly) 
Thrown from your horse? How embarrassing.

MISS CALDWELL: 
(amused) 
I wish I could have seen it.

ALFRED: 
(irritated) 
Well, I'm sure you'll find plenty of amusement in my misfortune.

NARRATOR: 
The tension between the three travelers was palpable as they continued their journey. Miss Caldwell's impatience grew with each passing day, longing for the comfort of her home. Alfred's embarrassment lingered, and the young Easterner's teasing only added to his discomfort.

ALLEN: 
(riding up to Miss Caldwell) 
Care for a race, Miss Caldwell?

MISS CALDWELL: 
(smiling) 
I'm not sure my horse can keep up with yours, Allen.

ALLEN: 
(teasing) 
I'll go easy on you, I promise.

MISS CALDWELL: 
(mock serious) 
I wouldn't want to bruise your ego, Allen.

V.O. (Miss Caldwell) ""Mock serious, Miss Caldwell. Don't let him get to you. You're stronger than that. But damn, this heat is unbearable. And this journey...why did I agree to this? Oh right, adventure. But at what cost? My patience, my comfort, my sanity? I can't wait to be home.""

ALLEN: 
(laughing) 
My ego can handle it.

NARRATOR: 
The two raced off, leaving Alfred behind. He watched them with a mixture of envy and annoyance.

ALFRED: 
(to himself) 
Why do they always leave me behind?

NARRATOR: 
As the days passed, the travelers grew closer, their bond strengthened by the challenges of the journey. Miss Caldwell's impatience faded, replaced by a sense of adventure and camaraderie.

MISS CALDWELL: 
(riding up to Alfred) 
Tell us another story, Alfred.

ALFRED: 
(smiling) 
I'm afraid I've run out of stories to tell.

YOUNG EASTERNER: 
(teasing) 
Or perhaps you're just too embarrassed to share them with us.

ALFRED: 
(rolling his eyes) 
I'll have you know, I have plenty of stories that would put your adventures to shame.

MISS CALDWELL: 
(laughing) 
I'm sure you do, Alfred.

NARRATOR: 
The three continued their journey, their bond growing stronger with each passing day. Despite the challenges and discomforts of the plains journey, they found joy and companionship in each other's company. And as they rode off into the horizon, they knew that they would always have these memories to look back on with fondness.

There was a sheer drop of more than a mile straight down, and at the distant bottom were jagged rocks and stunted trees that looked, in the blue haze, like shrubbery.  ""This is the spot,"" said the man to himself, ""and to-morrow morning is the time.""  John Bodman had planned his crime as grimly and relentlessly, and as coolly, as ever he had concocted a deal on the Stock Exchange. There was no thought in his mind of mercy for his unconscious victim. His hatred had carried him far.  The next morning after breakfast, he said to his wife: ""I intend to take a walk in the mountains. Do you wish to come with me?""  ""Yes,"" she answered briefly.  ""Very well, then,"" he said; ""I shall be ready at nine o'clock.""  ""I shall be ready at nine o'clock,"" she repeated after him.  At that hour they left the hotel together, to which he was shortly to return alone. They spoke no word to each other on their way to the Hanging Outlook. The path was practically level, skirting the mountains, for the Hanging Outlook was not much higher above the sea than the hotel.  John Bodman had formed no fixed plan for his procedure when the place was reached. He resolved to be guided by circumstances. Now and then a strange fear arose in his mind that she might cling to him and possibly drag him over the precipice with her. He found himself wondering whether she had any premonition of her fate, and one of his reasons for not speaking was the fear that a tremor in his voice might possibly arouse her suspicions. He resolved that his action should be sharp and sudden, that she might have no chance either to help herself or to drag him with her. Of her screams in that desolate region he had no fear. No one could reach the spot except from the hotel, and no one that morning had left the house, even for an expedition to the glacier--one of the easiest and most popular trips from the place.  Curiously enough, when they came within sight of the Hanging Outlook, Mrs. Bodman stopped and shuddered. Bodman looked at her through the narrow slits of his veiled eyes, and wondered again if she had any suspicion. No one can tell, when two people walk closely together, what unconscious communication one mind may have with another.  ",drama,suspenseful,"John Bodman, Mrs. Bodman","NARRATOR:

But as they stood there, looking out at the vast expanse below, a strange sense of calm washed over him. He knew what he had to do. And with one swift, decisive action, he pushed her over the edge.

And as he made his way back to the hotel, alone, he couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction, knowing that he had finally rid himself of the one person who had caused him so much pain.

JOHN:

This is just like a deal on the Stock Exchange. Cold, calculated, and without mercy.

Because I hate you, my dear. And now, I am finally free.

As John walked away, leaving his wife's lifeless body at the bottom of the cliff, he couldn't help but feel a sense of relief. He had gotten away with his crime, and no one would ever suspect him. But little did he know, his actions would come back to haunt him in the most unexpected way.

In perfect harmony were her ivory-clear complexion and deep sea-blue eyes that looked upon the world with the ingenuous calmness of a mermaid or the pixie of an undiscovered mountain stream. Her frame was strong and yet possessed the grace of absolute naturalness. And yet with all her Northern clearness and frankness of line and colouring, there seemed to be something of the tropics in her -- something of languor in the droop of her pose, of love of ease in her ingenious complacency of satisfaction and comfort in the mere act of breathing -- something that seemed to claim for her a right as a perfect work of nature to exist and be admired equally with a rare flower or some beautiful, milk-white dove among its sober-hued companions.  She was dressed in a white waist and dark skirt -- that discreet masquerade of goose-girl and duchess.  ""Vivienne,"" said Hartley, looking at her pleadingly, ""you did not answer my last letter.

V.O. (Vivienne) I can't believe I'm actually considering this. But there's something about Mr. Hartley that makes me feel safe. And I can't deny the excitement of living in the city. But what about my simple life here? I trust him, but can I trust myself to make the right decision?

HARTLEY: 
(tenderly) 
Then please, Vivienne, promise me. I want you by my side. You'll never regret choosing me and the life I can offer you.

V.O. (Hartley) Hartley's words are like a warm embrace, promising a life of love and security. But can I leave the city and all its excitement? Vivienne, you must choose. My heart aches at the thought of losing you, but I'll respect your decision. Please, choose me.

VIVIENNE: 
(looking down at her folded hands) 
I promise, Mr. Hartley. I will come with you.

"Who and where was Miggles? The Judge, our authority, did not remember the name, and he knew the country thoroughly. The Washoe traveler thought Miggles must keep a hotel. We only knew that we were stopped by high water in front and rear, and that Miggles was our rock of refuge. A ten minutes splashing through a tangled by- road, scarcely wide enough for the stage, and we drew up before a barred and boarded gate in a wide stone wall or fence about eight feet high. Evidently Miggles's, and evidently Miggles did not keep a hotel.  The driver got down and tried the gate. It was securely locked. Miggles! O Miggles!""  No answer.  ""Migg-ells! You Miggles!"" continued the driver, with rising wrath.  ""Migglesy!"" joined the expressman, persuasively. ""O Miggy! Mig!""  But no reply came from the apparently insensate Miggles. The Judge, who had finally got the window down, put his head out and propounded a series of questions, which if answered categorically would have undoubtedly elucidated the whole mystery, but which the driver evaded by replying that ""if we didn't want to sit in the coach all night, we had better rise up and sing out for Miggles.""  So we rose up and called on Miggles in chorus; then separately. And when we had finished, a Hibernian fellow-passenger from the roof called for ""Maygells!"" whereat we all laughed. While we were laughing, the driver cried ""Shoo!""  We listened. To our infinite amazement the chorus of ""Miggles"" was repeated from the other side of the wall, even to the final and supplemental ""Maygells.""  ""Extraordinary echo,"" said the Judge.

What is this Miggles hiding? Why won't he show himself? Is he afraid of something? Or is he just a coward? I wouldn't hide like this, not in the face of danger. But then again, I'm not Miggles.

"Corley's stride acknowledged the compliment. The swing of his burly body made his friend execute a few light skips from the path to the roadway and back again. Corley was the son of an inspector of police and he had inherited his father's frame and gut. He walked with his hands by his sides, holding himself erect and swaying his head from side to side. His head was large, globular and oily; it sweated in all weathers; and his large round hat, set upon it sideways, looked like a bulb which had grown out of another. He always stared straight before him as if he were on parade and, when he wished to gaze after someone in the street, it was necessary for him to move his body from the hips. At present he was about town. Whenever any job was vacant a friend was always ready to give him the hard word. He was often to be seen walking with policemen in plain clothes, talking earnestly. He knew the inner side of all affairs and was fond of delivering final judgments. He spoke without listening to the speech of his companions. His conversation was mainly about himself what he had said to such a person and what such a person had said to him and what he had said to settle the matter. When he reported these dialogues he aspirated the first letter of his name after the manner of Florentines.  Lenehan offered his friend a cigarette. As the two young men walked on through the crowd Corley occasionally turned to smile at some of the passing girls but Lenehan's gaze was fixed on the large faint moon circled with a double halo. He watched earnestly the passing of the grey web of twilight across its face. At length he said:  ""Well... tell me, Corley, I suppose you'll be able to pull it off all right, eh?""  Corley closed one eye expressively as an answer.  ""Is she game for that?"" asked Lenehan dubiously. ""You can never know women.""  ""She's all right,"" said Corley. ""I know the way to get around her, man. She's a bit gone on me.""  ""You're what I call a gay Lothario,"" said Lenehan. ""And the proper kind of a Lothario, too!""  A shade of mockery relieved the servility of his manner. To save himself he had the habit of leaving his flattery open to the interpretation of raillery. But Corley had not a subtle mind.  ""There's nothing to touch a good slavey,"" he affirmed. ""Take my tip for it."" ",fiction,serious,"Corley, Lenehan, Harpist","CORLEY:

Memories of a past love resurface as he reflects on the artful nature of human relationships.

"Men climbed the trunks, everywhere shaking the laden branches and hitting them with long bamboo poles to knock the fruit off, while women and children, squatting on their haunches, spent laborious hours filling baskets underneath, then loading mules and donkeys with their daily ""catch."" But an olive to eat was unobtainable. He had never cared for olives, but now he craved with all his soul to feel his teeth in one.  ""Ach! But it is the Spanish olive that you eat,"" explained the head waiter, a German ""from Basel."" ""These are for oil only."" After which he disliked the olive more than ever--until that night when he saw the first eatable specimen rolling across the shiny parquet floor, propelled towards him by the careless hand of a pretty girl, who then looked up into his eyes and smiled.  He was convinced that Eve, similarly, had rolled the apple towards Adam across the emerald sward of the first garden in the world.  He slept usually like the dead. It must have been something very real that made him open his eyes and sit up in bed alertly. There was a noise against his door. He listened. The room was still quite dark. It was early morning. The noise was not repeated.  ""Who's there?"" he asked in a sleepy whisper. ""What is it?""  The noise came again. Some one was scratching on the door. No, it was somebody tapping.  ""What do you want?"" he demanded in a louder voice. ""Come in,"" he added, wondering sleepily whether he was presentable. Either the hotel was on fire or the porter was waking the wrong person for some sunrise expedition.  Nothing happened. Wide awake now, he turned the switch on, but no light flooded the room. The electricians, he remembered with a curse, were out on strike. He fumbled for the matches, and as he did so a voice in the corridor became distinctly audible. It was just outside his door.  ""Aren't you ready?"" he heard. ""You sleep for ever.""  And the voice, although never having heard it before, he could not have recognised it, belonged, he knew suddenly, to the girl who had let the olive fall. In an instant he was out of bed. He lit a candle.  ""I'm coming,"" he called softly, as he slipped rapidly into some clothes. ""I'm sorry I've kept you. I shan't be a minute.""  ""Be quick then!"" he heard, while the candle flame slowly grew, and he found his garments. Less than three minutes later he opened the door and, candle in hand, peered into the dark passage.  ""Blow it out!"" came a peremptory whisper. He obeyed, but not quick enough. A pair of red lips emerged from the shadows. There was a puff, and the candle was extinguished.

They wandered through the dark streets, their hearts racing with excitement and anticipation. And as they reached their destination, they knew that this was just the beginning of their romantic journey together.

"Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. ""Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else. ""Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion. ""How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?"" he asked. ""How did you know, for example, that I did manual labour. It's as true as gospel, for I began as a ship's carpenter."" ""Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed."" ""Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?""  ""I won't insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin."" ""Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?"" ""What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?""  ""Well, but China?"" ""The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple."" Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. ""Well, I never!"" said he. ""I thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was nothing in it, after all."" ""I begin to think, Watson,"" said Holmes, ""that I make a mistake in explaining. 'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,' you know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?"" ""Yes, I have got it now,"" he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column. ""Here it is. This is what began it all. You just read it for yourself, sir.""",mystery,serious,"Sherlock Holmes, Mr. Jabez Wilson, Doctor","NARRATOR: 
The room is dimly lit, casting shadows on the walls of Sherlock Holmes' office. The air is heavy with the scent of tobacco and the faint smell of ink. Holmes sits at his desk, his sharp eyes taking in every detail of the man before him. Mr. Jabez Wilson shifts nervously in his chair, his fingers tapping on the armrest. The sound echoes in the quiet room.

Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.

SHERLOCK HOLMES: 
(smiling) 
My dear sir, it's elementary. Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left, indicating manual labor. The arc-and-compass breastpin gives away your Freemason membership, and the shiny cuff and smooth patch on your sleeves reveal your recent writing endeavors. As for China, the fish tattoo on your wrist and the Chinese coin on your watch-chain are clear indications.

SHERLOCK HOLMES: 
(serious) 
I begin to think, Watson, that I make a mistake in explaining. 'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,' you know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid.

V.O. (Sherlock Holmes) I can see the doubt in Watson's eyes. But I can't let my reputation suffer for the sake of being candid. My deductions are flawless, as always. The tension in the room is thick, but I must continue. My sharp senses have uncovered every detail. I must solve this case.

NARRATOR: 
The tension in the room is palpable as Mr. Wilson's eyes widen in amazement. Holmes' keen senses have uncovered every detail, from the calluses on Mr. Wilson's hands to the faint scent of Chinese spices. The mystery begins to unravel as Holmes explains his deductions, his reputation at stake.

SHERLOCK HOLMES: 
(takes the advertisement and reads it) 
""Red-headed League. On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of four pounds a week for purely nominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at eleven o'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7 Pope's Court, Fleet Street.""

NARRATOR: 
The room is filled with anticipation as Mr. Wilson hands Holmes the advertisement that started it all. Holmes' quick eye takes in the details of the advertisement, and he nods in understanding.

SHERLOCK HOLMES: 
(serious) 
I see. This is quite an interesting case, Mr. Wilson. I believe we should pay a visit to this Duncan Ross on Monday at eleven o'clock.

V.O. (Sherlock Holmes) ""Interesting. The clues are all there, but there's something missing. I can feel it. Monday at eleven o'clock, that's when it will all come together.

NARRATOR: 
And so, the mystery of the Red-headed League begins, with Sherlock Holmes and Mr. Jabez Wilson at the helm. The room is filled with anticipation as the two men prepare to unravel the secrets behind this peculiar advertisement. Little do they know, this case will lead them on a wild and dangerous adventure, testing their skills and wit to the limit. But with Sherlock Holmes on the case, there is no doubt that the truth will be uncovered.

"Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter. ""I cannot see that there is anything very funny,"" cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. ""If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.""  ""No, no,"" cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. ""I really wouldn't miss your case for the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?"" ""I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground-floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him. ""'Well,' said I, 'the gentleman at No. 4.' ""'What, the red-headed man?' ""'Yes.' ""'Oh,' said he, 'his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.' ""'Where could I find him?' ""'Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul's.' ""I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross."" ""And what did you do then?"" asked Holmes. ""I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you."" ""And you did very wisely,"" said Holmes. ""Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear."" ""Grave enough!"" said Mr. Jabez Wilson.

"We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes. ""You are not very vulnerable from above,"" Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him. ""Nor from below,"" said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. ""Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!"" he remarked, looking up in surprise.

"Hundreds of miles from CERN, a voice crackled through a walkie-talkie. “Okay, I’m in the hallway.” The technician monitoring the video screens pressed the button on his transmitter. “You’re looking for camera #86. It’s supposed to be at the far end.” There was a long silence on the radio. The waiting technician broke a light sweat. Finally his radio clicked. “The camera isn’t here,” the voice said. “I can see where it was mounted, though. Somebody must have removed it.” The technician exhaled heavily. “Thanks.

Thanks for your help.” He turned off his walkie-talkie and pursed his lips. Considering the small size of the video camera and the fact that it was wireless, the technician knew that camera #86 could be transmitting from just about anywhere within the heavily guarded compound—a densely packed collection of thirty-two separate buildings covering a half-mile radius. The only clue was that the camera seemed to have been placed somewhere dark. Of course, that wasn’t much help. The complex contained endless dark locations —maintenance closets, heating ducts, gardening sheds, bedroom wardrobes, even a labyrinth of underground tunnels. Camera #86 could take weeks to locate.

TECHNICIAN: 
(frowns) 
Never mind. Thanks for your help.

NARRATOR: 
The technician turned off his walkie-talkie and pursed his lips. Considering the small size of the video camera and the fact that it was wireless, he knew that camera #86 could be transmitting from just about anywhere within the heavily guarded compound—a densely packed collection of thirty-two separate buildings covering a half-mile radius. The only clue was that the camera seemed to have been placed somewhere dark. Of course, that wasn't much help. The complex contained endless dark locations—maintenance closets, heating ducts, gardening sheds, bedroom wardrobes, even a labyrinth of underground tunnels. Camera #86 could take weeks to locate.

TECHNICIAN: 
(rubs temples) 
This is going to be a nightmare.

V.O. (Technician) Great, just what I needed. Another problem to deal with. Why does this always happen to me? I can feel the headache coming on already. I hope this doesn't take too long, I have a million other things to do. Why can't anything ever go smoothly around here?

NARRATOR: 
But that's the least of his problems, he thought. Despite the dilemma posed by the camera's relocation, there was another far more unsettling matter at hand. The technician knew that he had to act fast to find the missing camera and uncover the truth behind its disappearance.

SUPERIOR: 
(entering the room) 
Technician, any updates on camera #86?

TECHNICIAN: 
(shakes head) 
Not yet, sir. But I have a feeling it's still inside the complex.

SUPERIOR: 
(nods) 
I trust your instincts, Technician. We can't afford to have a missing camera in the hands of someone with malicious intent.

NARRATOR: 
Superior was a highly skilled and intelligent individual, with a sharp eye for detail and a keen sense of observation. Their role as a technician at the complex was crucial, as they were responsible for monitoring the video screens and ensuring the safety and security of the facility. But Superior's skills were put to the test when camera #86 went missing. Despite the challenges posed by the camera's relocation, Superior remained calm and focused, determined to solve the mystery and protect the complex. Their dedication and quick thinking made them an invaluable asset, but as they delved deeper into the investigation, they realized that there may be more at stake than just a missing camera. Superior's sharp mind and unwavering determination would be put to the ultimate test as they uncovered the unsettling truth behind the camera's disappearance.

SUPERIOR: 
(paces) 
We need to find that camera before it falls into the wrong hands.

TECHNICIAN: 
(nods) 
I'm on it, sir.

NARRATOR: 
The technician and Superior worked tirelessly, searching every nook and cranny of the complex for camera #86. As the hours passed, the tension and suspense grew, and the stakes became higher. But they refused to give up, knowing that the safety of the complex depended on their success.

TECHNICIAN: 
(excited) 
Copy that. Where are you?

NARRATOR: 
The technician and Superior rushed to the location, their hearts racing with anticipation. As they approached the camera, they noticed something strange. It was pointed towards a door that led to a restricted area of the complex.

TECHNICIAN: 
(eyes widening) 
That's the door to the experimental lab.

SUPERIOR: 
(serious) 
We need to get in there and secure that camera before anyone else finds it.

NARRATOR: 
The two of them quickly entered the lab, and to their relief, the missing camera was there, safely tucked away in a corner. But as they turned to leave, they noticed something else. The door to the lab was slightly ajar, and there was a faint sound coming from inside.

NARRATOR: 
The technician and Superior exchanged a worried glance, knowing that they had to act fast. They cautiously entered the lab, their hearts pounding with fear and anticipation. And as they turned the corner, they came face to face with the mysterious figure behind the missing camera.

NARRATOR: 
The technician and Superior were shocked to see that the voice on the walkie-talkie belonged to none other than the head of security at the complex. He had been using the missing camera to spy on the employees and gather sensitive information.

TECHNICIAN: 
(angrily) 
Why would you do this?

HEAD OF SECURITY: 
(smirks) 
I wanted to see what you were all up to. And now, I have all the information I need to take over this complex.

NARRATOR: 
The technician and Superior quickly apprehended the head of security and secured the camera, saving the complex from a potential disaster. As they looked back on the events of the day, they couldn't help but feel a sense of relief and pride in their quick thinking and determination. And as they returned to their duties, they knew that they would always be ready to face any challenge that came their way.

"Do I have your attention now?” the man’s voice said when Langdon finally answered the line. “Yes, sir, you damn well do. You want to explain yourself?” “I tried to tell you before.” The voice was rigid, mechanical. “I’m a physicist. I run a research facility. We’ve had a murder.

The atmosphere in the CERN boardroom was tense, the air thick with the weight of scientific discovery. The smell of coffee and stale pastries lingered, a stark contrast to the gravity of the conversation. Langdon shifted in his seat, feeling the weight of Kohler's words. The sound of papers rustling and pens scratching filled the room, a symphony of intellectual discourse. The bright fluorescent lights glared down, casting harsh shadows across the faces of the scientists. The tension was palpable, a reminder that the battle between science and religion was far from over.

"Not many children could say they remembered the day they met their father, but Vittoria Vetra could. She was eight years old, living where she always had, Orfanotrofio di Siena, a Catholic orphanage near Florence, deserted by parents she never knew. It was raining that day. The nuns had called for her twice to come to dinner, but as always she pretended not to hear. She lay outside in the courtyard, staring up at the raindrops . . . feeling them hit her body . . . trying to guess where one would land next. The nuns called again, threatening that pneumonia might make an insufferably headstrong child a lot less curious about nature. I can’t hear you, Vittoria thought. She was soaked to the bone when the young priest came out to get her. She didn’t know him. He was new there. Vittoria waited for him to grab her and drag her back inside. But he didn’t. Instead, to her wonder, he lay down beside her, soaking his robes in a puddle. “They say you ask a lot of questions,” the young man said. Vittoria scowled. “Are questions bad?” He laughed. “Guess they were right.” “What are you doing out here?” “Same thing you’re doing . . . wondering why raindrops fall.” “I’m not wondering why they fall! I already know!” The priest gave her an astonished look. “You do?” “Sister Francisca says raindrops are angels’ tears coming down to wash away our sins.” “Wow!” he said, sounding amazed. “So that explains it.” “No it doesn’t!” the girl fired back. “Raindrops fall because everything falls! Everything falls! Not just rain!” The priest scratched his head, looking perplexed. “You know, young lady, you’re right. Everything does fall. It must be gravity.” “It must be what?” He gave her an astonished look. “You haven’t heard of gravity?” “No.” The priest shrugged sadly. “Too bad. Gravity answers a lot of questions.” Vittoria sat up. “What’s gravity?” she demanded. “Tell me!” The priest gave her a wink. “What do you say I tell you over dinner.” The young priest was Leonardo Vetra. Although he had been an awardwinning physics student while in university, he’d heard another call and gone into the seminary. Leonardo and Vittoria became unlikely best friends in the lonely world of nuns and regulations. Vittoria made Leonardo laugh, and he took her under his wing, teaching her that beautiful things like rainbows and the rivers had many explanations. He told her about light, planets, stars, and all of nature through the eyes of both God and science. Vittoria’s innate intellect and curiosity made her a captivating student.

"Phileas Fogg rightly suspected that his departure from London would create a lively sensation at the West End. The news of the bet spread through the Reform Club, and afforded an exciting topic of conversation to its members. From the club it soon got into the papers throughout England. The boasted ""tour of the world"" was talked about, disputed, argued with as much warmth as if the subject were another Alabama claim. Some took sides with Phileas Fogg, but the large majority shook their heads and declared against him; it was absurd, impossible, they declared, that the tour of the world could be made, except theoretically and on paper, in this minimum of time, and with the existing means of travelling. The Times, Standard, Morning Post, and Daily News, and twenty other highly respectable newspapers scouted Mr. Fogg's project as madness; the Daily Telegraph alone hesitatingly supported him. People in general thought him a lunatic, and blamed his Reform Club friends for having accepted a wager which betrayed the mental aberration of its proposer.  Articles no less passionate than logical appeared on the question, for geography is one of the pet subjects of the English; and the columns devoted to Phileas Fogg's venture were eagerly devoured by all classes of readers. At first some rash individuals, principally of the gentler sex, espoused his cause, which became still more popular when the Illustrated London News came out with his portrait, copied from a photograph in the Reform Club. A few readers of the Daily Telegraph even dared to say, ""Why not, after all? Stranger things have come to pass.""  At last a long article appeared, on the 7th of October, in the bulletin of the Royal Geographical Society, which treated the question from every point of view, and demonstrated the utter folly of the enterprise.  Everything, it said, was against the travellers, every obstacle imposed alike by man and by nature. A miraculous agreement of the times of departure and arrival, which was impossible, was absolutely necessary to his success. He might, perhaps, reckon on the arrival of trains at the designated hours, in Europe, where the distances were relatively moderate; but when he calculated upon crossing India in three days, and the United States in seven, could he rely beyond misgiving upon accomplishing his task?

"Presently we saw that the cavern before us opened upon a hazy void. In another moment we had emerged upon a sort of slanting gallery, that projected into a vast circular space, a huge cylindrical pit running vertically up and down. Round this pit the slanting gallery ran without any parapet or protection for a turn and a half, and then plunged high above into the rock again. Somehow it reminded me then one of those spiral turns of the railway through the Saint Gothard. It was all tremendously huge. I can scarcely hope to convey to you the Titanic proportion of all that place, the Titanic effect of it. Our eyes followed up the vast declivity of the pit wall, and overhead and far above we beheld a round opening set with faint stars, and half of the lip about it well nigh blinding with the white light of the sun. At that we cried aloud simultaneously.  ""Come on!"" I said, leading the way.  ""But there?"" said Cavor, and very carefully stepped nearer the edge of the gallery. I followed his example, and craned forward and looked down, but I was dazzled by that gleam of light above, and I could see only a bottomless darkness with spectral patches of crimson and purple floating therein. Yet if I could not see, I could hear. Out of this darkness came a sound, a sound like the angry hum one can hear if one puts one's ear outside a hive of bees, a sound out of that enormous hollow, it may be, four miles beneath our feet...  For a moment I listened, then tightened my grip on my crowbar, and led the way up the gallery.  ""This must be the shaft we looked down upon,"" said Cavor. ""Under that lid.""  ""And below there, is where we saw the lights.""  ""The lights!"" said he. ""Yes--the lights of the world that now we shall never see.""  ""We'll come back,"" I said, for now we had escaped so much I was rashly sanguine that we should recover the sphere.  His answer I did not catch.  ""Eh?"" I asked.  ""It doesn't matter,"" he answered, and we hurried on in silence.  I suppose that slanting lateral way was four or five miles long, allowing for its curvature, and it ascended at a slope that would have made it almost impossibly steep on earth, but which one strode up easily under lunar conditions.

I followed his lead, craning my neck to see what lay beneath us. But the blinding light from above made it difficult to see anything.

CAVOR: 
(trying to see) 
And below there, is where we saw the lights.

V.O. (Cavor) ""Wow, those lights are blinding. I can barely see anything. But I have to keep trying. This cavern is unlike anything I've ever seen before. The vastness of it all is overwhelming. I can't help but feel small and insignificant in the face of such grandeur.""

NARRATOR: 
The lights! I remembered them now. The strange, otherworldly lights that had led us to this place.

CAVOR: 
(sighing) 
Yes, the lights of the world that now we shall never see.

NARRATOR: 
But I refused to give up hope. We had come so far, escaped so much. Surely we could find a way back to the surface and recover our sphere.

CAVOR: 
(optimistic) 
We'll come back.

NARRATOR: 
I said, determined to find a way. But Cavor's response was lost in the sound of a low, angry hum.

[SFX : HUM]

CAVOR: 
(listening) 
Do you hear that?

NARRATOR: 
I strained my ears, trying to make sense of the noise. It sounded like the angry buzz of a beehive, but much louder and more ominous.

[SFX : BUZZ]

CAVOR: 
(realizing) 
It's coming from below. From that enormous hollow, four miles beneath our feet.

NARRATOR: 
We exchanged a worried glance before tightening our grips on our crowbars and continuing up the gallery.

CAVOR: 
(whispering) 
This must be the shaft we saw from above.

NARRATOR: 
We crept forward, our footsteps echoing through the cavernous space. Suddenly, we heard a sound that made us freeze in our tracks.

[SFX : FOOTSTEPS]

NARRATOR: 
We spun around to see two Selenites running towards us, their long limbs moving gracefully as they closed in on us.

CAVOR: 
(panicking) 
What do we do?

NARRATOR: 
I raised my crowbar, ready to defend ourselves, but the Selenites stopped just a few feet away from us.

NARRATOR: 
Their voices echoed in our minds, and I could feel their curiosity and caution.

CAVOR: 
(whispering) 
They communicate telepathically.

NARRATOR: 
I nodded, still wary of these strange creatures.

NARRATOR: 
I looked to Cavor, unsure of how to answer. But he stepped forward, determined to make contact with these creatures.

CAVOR: 
(telepathically) 
We are explorers from Earth. We came here in a sphere, but we crashed and ended up in this cavern.

NARRATOR: 
The Selenites exchanged a glance before turning back to us.

NARRATOR: 
I felt a surge of excitement and curiosity. What did they mean by that?

CAVOR: 
(telepathically) 
What do you mean?

NARRATOR: 
I couldn't believe what I was hearing. We were the first humans to successfully reach the moon?

NARRATOR: 
I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. But then a thought struck me.

NARRATOR: 
(telepathically) 
But how did you know we were coming?

NARRATOR: 
I was amazed by their advanced technology and intelligence. But then another thought occurred to me.

NARRATOR: 
(telepathically) 
Can you help us get back to the surface? We need to retrieve our sphere.

NARRATOR: 
I exchanged a glance with Cavor, and we both nodded in agreement. We followed the Selenites deeper into the cavern, eager to see what other wonders this strange world held.

"There was a whirr. The clock shuddered and all at once the door opened. The cuckoo came out, sliding swiftly. He paused and looked around solemnly, scrutinizing her, the room, the furniture.  It was the first time he had seen her, she realized, smiling to herself in pleasure. She stood up, coming toward him shyly. ""Go on,"" she said. ""I'm waiting.""  The cuckoo opened his bill. He whirred and chirped, quickly, rhythmically. Then, after a moment of contemplation, he retired. And the door snapped shut.  She was delighted. She clapped her hands and spun in a little circle. He was marvelous, perfect! And the way he had looked around, studying her, sizing her up. He liked her; she was certain of it. And she, of course, loved him at once, completely. He was just what she had hoped would come out of the little door.  Doris went to the clock. She bent over the little door, her lips close to the wood. ""Do you hear me?"" she whispered. ""I think you're the most wonderful cuckoo in the world."" She paused, embarrassed. ""I hope you'll like it here.""  Then she went downstairs again, slowly, her head high.  Larry and the cuckoo clock really never got along well from the start. Doris said it was because he didn't wind it right, and it didn't like being only half-wound all the time. Larry turned the job of winding over to her; the cuckoo came out every quarter hour and ran the spring down without remorse, and someone had to be ever after it, winding it up again.  Doris did her best, but she forgot a good deal of the time. Then Larry would throw his newspaper down with an elaborate weary motion and stand up. He would go into the dining-room where the clock was mounted on the wall over the fireplace. He would take the clock down and making sure that he had his thumb over the little door, he would wind it up.  ""Why do you put your thumb over the door?"" Doris asked once.  ""You're supposed to.""  She raised an eyebrow. ""Are you sure? I wonder if it isn't that you don't want him to come out while you're standing so close.""  ""Why not?""  ""Maybe you're afraid of him.""  Larry laughed. He put the clock back on the wall and gingerly removed his thumb. When Doris wasn't looking he examined his thumb.",fiction,humorous,"Doris, Larry","NARRATOR: 
Doris' living room was filled with the sound of a whirring clock, causing the furniture to shudder. Suddenly, the door opened and out slid a cuckoo, pausing to scrutinize the room and its inhabitants. Doris smiled in delight, realizing it was the first time the cuckoo had seen her. She shyly approached him, urging him to continue with his rhythmic chirping. After a moment of contemplation, the cuckoo retreated back into the clock and the door snapped shut. Doris clapped her hands and spun in a circle, completely enamored with the marvelous bird.

DORIS: 
(smiling) 
Go on. I'm waiting.

CUCKOO: 
(opening his bill) 
Whirr, chirp, chirp, chirp.

Doris was delighted with the cuckoo's performance. She couldn't help but clap and spin in a little circle.

[SFX : CLAP]

DORIS: 
(clapping) 
He's marvelous! Perfect!

V.O. (Doris) ""He's marvelous! Perfect!"" Doris thought, clapping her hands in excitement. The cuckoo clock was her pride and joy, a constant source of wonder and joy. She couldn't wait to show it off to Larry, despite his fear of the bird. Maybe this time he'll see how special it truly is.

NARRATOR: 
Doris was certain that the cuckoo liked her too. She had hoped for a charming little bird to come out of the clock, and that's exactly what she got.

DORIS: 
(whispering) 
Do you hear me? I think you're the most wonderful cuckoo in the world.

NARRATOR: 
Doris paused, feeling a bit embarrassed.

DORIS: 
(whispering) 
I hope you'll like it here.

V.O. (Doris) I can't believe it, a real cuckoo in my living room! It's so beautiful and magical. I hope Larry doesn't ruin this moment like he always does. I'll have to be extra careful to keep the clock wound and make sure the cuckoo stays safe. But it's worth it, I love having this little piece of nature in our home.

NARRATOR: 
Doris went downstairs, her head held high. But her husband Larry and the cuckoo clock didn't get along very well.

LARRY: 
(sighing) 
Doris, I don't think you're winding the clock properly. It's not working right.

DORIS: 
(defensive) 
I'm doing my best!

LARRY: 
(irritated) 
Well, I'm tired of dealing with it. You wind it from now on.

NARRATOR: 
Doris took on the responsibility of winding the clock, but she often forgot. This caused tension between her and Larry.

LARRY: 
(throwing down his newspaper) 
Here we go again. I'll have to wind it myself.

NARRATOR: 
Larry went into the dining room where the clock was mounted on the wall. He made sure to cover the little door with his thumb before winding it.

DORIS: 
(curious) 
Why do you put your thumb over the door?

LARRY: 
(defensive) 
You're supposed to.

DORIS: 
(raising an eyebrow) 
Are you sure? Maybe you're just afraid of the cuckoo.

LARRY: 
(laughing) 
Afraid of a little bird? Don't be ridiculous.

NARRATOR: 
But secretly, Larry was a bit afraid of the cuckoo. He didn't want it to come out while he was standing so close.

LARRY: 
(removing his thumb) 
See? Nothing to be afraid of.

NARRATOR: 
Doris couldn't help but smile at her husband's antics. She loved the cuckoo clock and its charming little bird, and she was determined to keep it running smoothly.

DORIS: 
(determined) 
I'll make sure to wind it every day from now on.

NARRATOR: 
And from that day on, the cuckoo clock ran perfectly, thanks to Doris' love and care.

"One day Murlock returned from gunning in a distant part of the forest to find his wife prostrate with fever, and delirious. There was no physician within miles, no neighbor; nor was she in a condition to be left, to summon help. So he set about the task of nursing her back to health, but at the end of the third day she fell into unconsciousness arid so passed away, apparently, with never a gleam of returning reason.  From what we know of a nature like his we may venture to sketch in some of the details of the outline picture drawn by my grandfather. When convinced that she was dead, Murlock had sense enough to remember that the dead must be prepared for burial. In performance of this sacred duty he blundered now and again, did certain things incorrectly, and others which he did correctly were done over and over. His occasional failures to accomplish some simple and ordinary act filled him with astonishment, like that of a drunken man who wonders at the suspension of familiar natural laws. He was surprised, too, that he did not weep--surprised and a little ashamed; surely it is unkind not to weep for the dead. ""Tomorrow,"" he said aloud, ""I shall have to make the coffin arid dig the grave; and then I shall miss her, when she is no longer in sight; but now--she is dead, of course, but it is all right--it must be all right, somehow. Things cannot be so bad as they seem.""  He stood over the body in the fading light, adjusting the hair and putting the finishing touches to the simple toilet, doing all mechanically, with soulless care. And still through his consciousness ran an undersense of conviction that all was right--that he should have her again as before, and everything explained. He had had no experience in grief; his capacity had not been enlarged by use. His heart could not contain it all, nor his imagination rightly conceive it. He did not know he was so hard struck; that knowledge would come later, and never go. Grief is an artist of powers as various as the instruments upon which he plays his dirges for the dead, evoking from some the sharpest, shrillest notes, from others the low, grave chords that throb recurrent like the slow beating of a distant drum. Some natures it startles; some it stupefies. ",horror,suspenseful,"Murlock, Murlock's wife","MURLOCK:

"Every Sunday he met in this very spot Monsieur Sauvage, a stout, jolly, little man, a draper in the Rue Notre Dame de Lorette, and also an ardent fisherman. They often spent half the day side by side, rod in hand and feet dangling over the water, and a warm friendship had sprung up between the two.  Some days they did not speak; at other times they chatted; but they understood each other perfectly without the aid of words, having similar tastes and feelings.  In the spring, about ten o'clock in the morning, when the early sun caused a light mist to float on the water and gently warmed the backs of the two enthusiastic anglers, Morissot would occasionally remark to his neighbor:  ""My, but it's pleasant here.""  To which the other would reply:  ""I can't imagine anything better!""  And these few words sufficed to make them understand and appreciate each other.  In the autumn, toward the close of day, when the setting sun shed a blood-red glow over the western sky, and the reflection of the crimson clouds tinged the whole river with red, brought a glow to the faces of the two friends, and gilded the trees, whose leaves were already turning at the first chill touch of winter, Monsieur Sauvage would sometimes smile at Morissot, and say:  ""What a glorious spectacle!""  And Morissot would answer, without taking his eyes from his float:  ""This is much better than the boulevard, isn't it?""  As soon as they recognized each other they shook hands cordially, affected at the thought of meeting under such changed circumstances.  Monsieur Sauvage, with a sigh, murmured:  ""These are sad times!""  Morissot shook his head mournfully.  ""And such weather! This is the first fine day of the year.""

"She tried to speak to the little quadroon boy; but no sound would come, at first. When he heard his name uttered, he looked up, and his mistress was pointing to the door. He laid aside the great, soft fan, and obediently stole away, over the polished floor, on his bare tiptoes. She stayed motionless, with gaze riveted upon her child, and her face the picture of fright. Presently her husband entered the room, and without noticing her, went to a table and began to search among some papers which covered it. ""Armand,"" she called to him, in a voice which must have stabbed him, if he was human. But he did not notice. ""Armand,"" she said again. Then she rose and tottered towards him. ""Armand,"" she panted once more, clutching his arm, ""look at our child. What does it mean? Tell me."" He coldly but gently loosened her fingers from about his arm and thrust the hand away from him. ""Tell me what it means!"" she cried despairingly. ""It means,"" he answered lightly, ""that the child is not white; it means that you are not white."" A quick conception of all that this accusation meant for her nerved her with unwonted courage to deny it. ""It is a lie; it is not true, I am white! Look at my hair, it is brown; and my eyes are gray, Armand, you know they are gray. And my skin is fair,"" seizing his wrist. ""Look at my hand; whiter than yours, Armand,"" she laughed hysterically. ""As white as La Blanche's,"" he returned cruelly; and went away leaving her alone with their child. When she could hold a pen in her hand, she sent a despairing letter to Madame Valmonde. ""My mother, they tell me I am not white. Armand has told me I am not white. For God's sake tell them it is not true. You must know it is not true. I shall die. I must die. I cannot be so unhappy, and live."" The answer that came was brief: ""My own Desiree: Come home to Valmonde; back to your mother who loves you. Come with your child.""

But what if it's not the truth? What if it's all just a lie?

V.O. (Desiree) ```
Desiree's mind races as she stands frozen in the doorway. What if everything I've known is a lie? Can I trust my own memories? Her voice trembles as she speaks, her fear palpable. But I have to know the truth. I have to face it, no matter how terrifying it may be.

ARMAND: 
(leans in close) 
I wish it were, Desiree. But it's not.

V.O. (Armand) Armand's heart aches as he sees the fear in Desiree's eyes. He wants to tell her the truth, but he can't bear to see her pain. He leans in close, hoping she can hear the unspoken words in his heart. ""I wish it were, Desiree. But it's not,"" he whispers, his voice filled with regret and sadness.

DESIREE: 
(voice breaking) 
Then what do I do? Where do I go?

ARMAND: 
(softly) 
Come home with me. To Valmonde. Your mother loves you, no matter what.

DESIREE: 
(voice trembling) 
And you? Do you still love me?

ARMAND: 
(leans in and kisses her forehead) 
Always.

NARRATOR: 
Desiree's heart is heavy as she takes her husband's hand and follows him out of the study. She knows that her life will never be the same, but she also knows that she has her mother's love and support. And that is enough to give her the strength to face whatever comes next.

"In the wan light, the faces of the men must have been grey. Their eyes must have glinted in strange ways as they gazed steadily astern. Viewed from a balcony, the whole thing would doubtless have been weirdly picturesque. But the men in the boat had no time to see it, and if they had had leisure there were other things to occupy their minds. The sun swung steadily up the sky, and they knew it was broad day because the color of the sea changed from slate to emerald-green, streaked with amber lights, and the foam was like tumbling snow.

The wan light of dawn cast a grey hue over the faces of the men in the boat, their eyes glinting in strange ways as they gazed steadily astern. From a balcony, the scene would have been weirdly picturesque, but the men had no time to see it. The sun slowly rose, changing the color of the sea from slate to emerald-green, streaked with amber lights. The foam churned like tumbling snow.

The cook and the correspondent debated the difference between a life-saving station and a house of refuge, while the oiler remained focused on the task at hand. The sea was changing color, from slate to emerald-green, streaked with amber lights. The foam churned like tumbling snow, a stark contrast to the calmness of the men's voices.

V.O. (The Correspondent) The correspondent's mind raced as the words echoed in his head. What if they were wrong? What if there was no one to save them? The thought of being stranded at sea, with no hope of rescue, filled him with a sense of dread. He couldn't shake off the feeling of impending doom.

The men were rescued and brought to shore, where they were greeted by the crew of the life-saving station. As they sat on the beach, watching the sun set over the horizon, they couldn't help but feel grateful for the cook's knowledge of the sea and the oiler's calmness in the face of danger. They had survived a harrowing experience, and they knew that they would never forget the lessons they learned on that small boat in the open sea.

"All round them lay a thick-strewn wreckage of splintered branches and broken twigs.  Relief at being alive and exasperation at his captive plight brought a strange medley of pious thank-offerings and sharp curses to Ulrich's lips. Georg, who was early blinded with the blood which trickled across his eyes, stopped his struggling for a moment to listen, and then gave a short, snarling laugh.  ""So you're not killed, as you ought to be, but you're caught, anyway,"" he cried; ""caught fast. Ho, what a jest, Ulrich von Gradwitz snared in his stolen forest. There's real justice for you!""  And he laughed again, mockingly and savagely.  ""I'm caught in my own forest-land,"" retorted Ulrich. ""When my men come to release us you will wish, perhaps, that you were in a better plight than caught poaching on a neighbour's land, shame on you.""  Georg was silent for a moment; then he answered quietly:  ""Are you sure that your men will find much to release? I have men, too, in the forest to-night, close behind me, and _they_ will be here first and do the releasing. When they drag me out from under these damned branches it won't need much clumsiness on their part to roll this mass of trunk right over on the top of you. Your men will find you dead under a fallen beech tree. For form's sake I shall send my condolences to your family.""  ""It is a useful hint,"" said Ulrich fiercely. ""My men had orders to follow in ten minutes time, seven of which must have gone by already, and when they get me out--I will remember the hint. Only as you will have met your death poaching on my lands I don't think I can decently send any message of condolence to your family.""  ""Good,"" snarled Georg, ""good. We fight this quarrel out to the death, you and I and our foresters, with no cursed interlopers to come between us. Death and damnation to you, Ulrich von Gradwitz.""  ""The same to you, Georg Znaeym, forest-thief, game-snatcher.""

The forest was shrouded in darkness, the only light coming from the moon peeking through the thick canopy of trees. The air was thick with the smell of damp earth and the sound of rustling leaves.

The two men, Ulrich and Georg, stood facing each other, their expressions a mix of relief, anger, and fear. The tension was palpable as they exchanged sharp words, both knowing that their fate lay in the hands of their men, who may or may not find them in time.

"Calixta, at home, felt no uneasiness for their safety. She sat at a side window sewing furiously on a sewing machine. She was greatly occupied and did not notice the approaching storm. But she felt very warm and often stopped to mop her face on which the perspiration gathered in beads. She unfastened her white sacque at the throat. It began to grow dark, and suddenly realizing the situation she got up hurriedly and went about closing windows and doors.  Out on the small front gallery she had hung Bobint's Sunday clothes to dry and she hastened out to gather them before the rain fell. As she stepped outside, Alce Laballire rode in at the gate. She had not seen him very often since her marriage, and never alone. She stood there with Bobint's coat in her hands, and the big rain drops began to fall. Alce rode his horse under the shelter of a side projection where the chickens had huddled and there were plows and a harrow piled up in the corner.  ""May I come and wait on your gallery till the storm is over, Calixta?"" he asked.  Come 'long in, M'sieur Alce.""  His voice and her own startled her as if from a trance, and she seized Bobint's vest. Alce, mounting to the porch, grabbed the trousers and snatched Bibi's braided jacket that was about to be carried away by a sudden gust of wind. He expressed an intention to remain outside, but it was soon apparent that he might as well have been out in the open: the water beat in upon the boards in driving sheets, and he went inside, closing the door after him. It was even necessary to put something beneath the door to keep the water out.  ""My! what a rain! It's good two years sence it rain' like that,"" exclaimed Calixta as she rolled up a piece of bagging and Alce helped her to thrust it beneath the crack.  She was a little fuller of figure than five years before when she married; but she had lost nothing of her vivacity. Her blue eyes still retained their melting quality; and her yellow hair, dishevelled by the wind and rain, kinked more stubbornly than ever about her ears and temples.  The rain beat upon the low, shingled roof with a force and clatter that threatened to break an entrance and deluge them there. They were in the dining room the sitting room the general utility room. Adjoining was her bed room, with Bibi's couch along side her own. The door stood open, and the room with its white, monumental bed, its closed shutters, looked dim and mysterious.

The two of them laughed and talked, reminiscing about old times. The storm raged on outside, but inside, Calixta and Alce were safe and warm in each other's company. As the night went on, their conversations grew more intimate, and their chemistry became undeniable.

As the storm finally passed, Alce knew he had to leave. He couldn't stay and risk causing any trouble for Calixta and her family. But before he left, he leaned in and kissed her, igniting a passion that had been simmering between them for years.

"She did not stop to ask if it were or were not a monstrous joy that held her. A clear and exalted perception enabled her to dismiss the suggestion as trivial. She knew that she would weep again when she saw the kind, tender hands folded in death; the face that had never looked save with love upon her, fixed and gray and dead. But she saw beyond that bitter moment a long procession of years to come that would belong to her absolutely. And she opened and spread her arms out to them in welcome.  There would be no one to live for during those coming years; she would live for herself. There would be no powerful will bending hers in that blind persistence with which men and women believe they have a right to impose a private will upon a fellow-creature. A kind intention or a cruel intention made the act seem no less a crime as she looked upon it in that brief moment of illumination.  And yet she had loved him--sometimes. Often she had not.

The Mallard house is quiet, save for the sound of Josephine's desperate pleas at the closed door. Louise stands by the open window, her eyes fixed on the horizon as she breathes in the fresh air. She knows that her husband is gone, and with him, the shackles that have bound her for so long. She feels a sense of freedom, of elation, coursing through her veins. She envisions the days ahead, full of life and possibility. But as she descends the stairs with her sister, she knows that her newfound joy will be short-lived. For she knows that her heart, once broken, can never be mended.

"One evening while Farquhar and his wife were sitting on a rustic bench near the entrance to his grounds, a gray-clad soldier rode up to the gate and asked for a drink of water. Mrs. Farquhar was only too happy to serve him with her own white hands. While she was fetching the water her husband approached the dusty horseman and inquired eagerly for news from the front.  ""The Yanks are repairing the railroads,"" said the man, ""and are getting ready for another advance. They have reached the Owl Creek bridge, put it in order and built a stockade on the north bank. The commandant has issued an order, which is posted everywhere, declaring that any civilian caught interfering with the railroad, its bridges, tunnels or trains will be summarily hanged. I saw the order.""  ""How far is it to the Owl Creek bridge?"" Farquhar asked.  ""About thirty miles.""  ""Is there no force on this side the creek?""  ""Only a picket post half a mile out, on the railroad, and a single sentinel at this end of the bridge.""  ""Suppose a man--a civilian and student of hanging--should elude the picket post and perhaps get the better of the sentinel,"" said Farquhar, smiling, ""what could he accomplish?""  The soldier reflected. ""I was there a month ago,"" he replied. ""I observed that the flood of last winter had lodged a great quantity of driftwood against the wooden pier at this end of the bridge. It is now dry and would burn like tow.""  The lady had now brought the water, which the soldier drank. He thanked her ceremoniously, bowed to her husband and rode away.

Farquhar's plantation is shrouded in darkness as the sun sets on the horizon. The air is thick with the scent of freshly cut grass and the sound of crickets chirping fills the night. Farquhar and his wife sit on a rustic bench, the wood creaking beneath them. Suddenly, a gray-clad soldier rides up to the gate, his horse kicking up dust as he dismounts. The soldier asks for water and Mrs. Farquhar eagerly obliges. As she fetches the water, Farquhar approaches the soldier, his heart racing with anticipation. The soldier reveals that the Yanks are advancing and have fortified the Owl Creek bridge. Farquhar's mind races as he contemplates the possibilities.

"""Do you think, Colonel, that your brave Coulter would like to put one of his guns in here?"" the general asked.  He was apparently not altogether serious; it certainly did not seem a place where any artillerist, however brave, would like to put a gun. The colonel thought that possibly his division commander meant good-humoredly to intimate that in a recent conversation between them Captain Coulter's courage had been too highly extolled.  ""General,"" he replied warmly, ""Coulter would like to put a gun anywhere within reach of those people,"" with a motion of his hand in the direction of the enemy.  ""It is the only place,"" said the general. He was serious, then.  The place was a depression, a ""notch,"" in the sharp crest of a hill. It was a pass, and through it ran a turnpike, which reaching this highest point in its course by a sinuous ascent through a thin forest made a similar, though less steep, descent toward the enemy. For a mile to the left and a mile to the right, the ridge, though occupied by Federal infantry lying close behind the sharp crest and appearing as if held in place by atmospheric pressure, was inaccessible to artillery. There was no place but the bottom of the notch, and that was barely wide enough for the roadbed. From the Confederate side this point was commanded by two batteries posted on a slightly lower elevation beyond a creek, and a half-mile away. All the guns but one were masked by the trees of an orchard; that one--it seemed a bit of impudence--was on an open lawn directly in front of a rather grandiose building, the planter's dwelling.

The oppressive heat of the summer afternoon hung heavy in the air, adding to the tension that permeated Coulter's Notch.

"Jerton had not harboured the least intention of extending his thirst for name-labels to his neighbour. After her rather remarkable announcement, however, he was obliged to say something in the way of polite inquiry.  ""Yes,"" answered the lady, ""I suppose it is a case of partial loss of memory. I was in the train coming down here; my ticket told me that I had come from Victoria and was bound for this place. I had a couple of five-pound notes and a sovereign on me, no visiting cards or any other means of identification, and no idea as to who I am. I can only hazily recollect that I have a title; I am Lady Somebody - beyond that my mind is a blank.""  ""Hadn't you any luggage with you?"" asked Jerton.  ""That is what I didn't know. I knew the name of this hotel and made up my mind to come here, and when the hotel porter who meets the trains asked if I had any luggage I had to invent a dressing-bag and dress-basket; I could always pretend that they had gone astray. I gave him the name of Smith, and presently he emerged from a confused pile of luggage and passengers with a dressing- bag and dress-basket labelled Kestrel-Smith. I had to take them; I don't see what else I could have done.""  Jerton said nothing, but he rather wondered what the lawful owner of the baggage would do.

"""There is a wild beast in your woods,"" said the artist Cunningham, as he was being driven to the station. It was the only remark he had made during the drive, but as Van Cheele had talked incessantly his companion's silence had not been noticeable.  ""A stray fox or two and some resident weasels. Nothing more formidable,"" said Van Cheele. The artist said nothing.  ""What did you mean about a wild beast?"" said Van Cheele later, when they were on the platform.  ""Nothing. My imagination. Here is the train,"" said Cunningham.  That afternoon Van Cheele went for one of his frequent rambles through his woodland property. He had a stuffed bittern in his study, and knew the names of quite a number of wild flowers, so his aunt had possibly some justification in describing him as a great naturalist. At any rate, he was a great walker. It was his custom to take mental notes of everything he saw during his walks, not so much for the purpose of assisting contemporary science as to provide topics for conversation afterwards. When the bluebells began to show themselves in flower he made a point of informing every one of the fact; the season of the year might have warned his hearers of the likelihood of such an occurrence, but at least they felt that he was being absolutely frank with them.  What Van Cheele saw on this particular afternoon was, however, something far removed from his ordinary range of experience. On a shelf of smooth stone overhanging a deep pool in the hollow of an oak coppice a boy of about sixteen lay asprawl, drying his wet brown limbs luxuriously in the sun. His wet hair, parted by a recent dive, lay close to his head, and his light-brown eyes, so light that there was an almost tigerish gleam in them, were turned towards Van Cheele with a certain lazy watchfulness. It was an unexpected apparition, and Van Cheele found himself engaged in the novel process of thinking before he spoke. Where on earth could this wild-looking boy hail from? The miller's wife had lost a child some two months ago, supposed to have been swept away by the mill-race, but that had been a mere baby, not a half-grown lad.  ""What are you doing there?"" he demanded.  ",mystery,suspenseful,"Van Cheele, Artist Cunningham, Wild boy","NARRATOR:

Van Cheele's footsteps crunched on the fallen leaves as he made his way through the woods, his senses on high alert. He couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. Suddenly, he came upon a deep pool, and there, sprawled on a shelf of smooth stone, was a boy of about sixteen, his wet hair and brown limbs glistening in the sunlight. But there was something wild and dangerous about him, something that sent a shiver down Van Cheele's spine. What was this mysterious boy doing here, and where had he come from? The air was thick with suspense as Van Cheele demanded an explanation.

[SFX : FOOTSTEPS]

VAN CHEELE: 
What are you doing here?

WILD BOY: 
(slowly sits up, a sly smile on his face) 
Just enjoying the sun, sir.

NARRATOR: 
Van Cheele's eyes narrowed as he took in the boy's appearance. He seemed to blend in with the natural surroundings, as if he were a part of the woods itself.

VAN CHEELE: 
(suspiciously) 
You seem to know these woods quite well.

WILD BOY: 
(stands up, stretching his arms) 
I've been here for a while. It's my home.

V.O. (Wild Boy) I've been here for a while. It's my home. But who is this man? Why is he here? I can sense his fear, but I won't let him harm my sanctuary. I'll stay hidden, watching and waiting. I won't let anyone take this away from me.

NARRATOR: 
Van Cheele's mind raced with questions. Who was this boy? How had he survived in the woods for so long? And most importantly, why was he here now?

VAN CHEELE: 
(voice trembling with excitement) 
You must tell me your story. How did you come to live in the woods?

WILD BOY: 
(smirks) 
That's a long story, sir. But I can assure you, it's not as exciting as you might think.

NARRATOR: 
Van Cheele's curiosity was piqued. He had always been fascinated by the mysteries of nature, and this boy was no exception. But there was something about him that made Van Cheele uneasy.

VAN CHEELE: 
(leans in closer) 
I don't believe you. There's something you're not telling me.

V.O. (Van Cheele) What is this boy hiding? He seems so out of place, yet he exudes an air of danger. I can't help but feel a sense of unease. Is he a threat? Or just a lost child? I need to know the truth. I won't let my guard down.

WILD BOY: 
(leans back, a hint of defiance in his eyes) 
And what if there is? What are you going to do about it?

V.O. (Wild Boy) What if there is? What am I going to do about it? I don't need anyone's help, especially not from this stranger. I can take care of myself. I've been surviving in these woods for years. I won't let anyone tell me what to do.

NARRATOR: 
Van Cheele was taken aback by the boy's boldness. He had expected him to be timid, perhaps even afraid. But this boy seemed to have no fear.

VAN CHEELE: 
(voice trembling with excitement) 
I want to help you. You don't have to live in the woods anymore. I can take you to a proper home, where you'll be safe and cared for.

V.O. (Van Cheele) Excitement surged through Van Cheele's body as he spoke, his voice trembling with anticipation. This boy needed help, and Van Cheele was determined to provide it. But as he looked at the wild, dangerous boy before him, he couldn't help but wonder what secrets he held.

WILD BOY: 
(eyes widen in surprise) 
A home? With walls and a roof?

NARRATOR: 
Van Cheele nodded, a smile spreading across his face. He had always been a kind and generous man, and this boy was no exception.

VAN CHEELE: 
Yes, a home. With a warm bed and plenty of food.

V.O. (Van Cheele) Yes, a home. With a warm bed and plenty of food. But what is this? A boy, alone in the woods? He looks wild, dangerous. I should be afraid, but I can't help feeling drawn to him. Who is he? Where did he come from? I must know.

NARRATOR: 
The boy's expression softened, and for a moment, he seemed almost human.

WILD BOY: 
(voice barely above a whisper) 
I've always dreamed of having a home. But I don't think I can leave the woods.

NARRATOR: 
Van Cheele's heart ached for the boy. He could see the conflict in his eyes, the struggle between his wild nature and his desire for a normal life.

VAN CHEELE: 
(voice filled with compassion) 
You don't have to decide now. Come with me, and we'll talk more about it.

NARRATOR: 
The boy hesitated for a moment, then nodded. Van Cheele smiled, relieved that he had made some progress.

VAN CHEELE: 
(extends a hand) 
Shall we go?

NARRATOR: 
The boy took his hand, and together they walked out of the woods, leaving behind the mysteries and dangers of the wild.

"Langdon strode silently behind Vittoria and Kohler as they moved back into the main atrium where Langdon’s bizarre visit had begun. Vittoria’s legs drove in fluid efficiency—like an Olympic diver—a potency, Langdon figured, no doubt born from the flexibility and control of yoga. He could hear her breathing slowly and deliberately, as if somehow trying to filter her grief. Langdon wanted to say something to her, offer his sympathy. He too had once felt the abrupt hollowness of unexpectedly losing a parent. He remembered the funeral mostly, rainy and gray. Two days after his twelfth birthday. The house was filled with gray-suited men from the office, men who squeezed his hand too hard when they shook it. They were all mumbling words like cardiac and stress. His mother joked through teary eyes that she’d always been able to follow the stock market simply by holding her husband’s hand . . . his pulse her own private ticker tape. Once, when his father was alive, Langdon had heard his mom begging his father to “stop and smell the roses.” That year, Langdon bought his father a tiny blown glass rose for Christmas. It was the most beautiful thing Langdon had ever seen . . . the way the sun caught it, throwing a rainbow of colors on the wall. “It’s lovely,” his father had said when he opened it, kissing Robert on the forehead. “Let’s find a safe spot for it.” Then his father had carefully placed the rose on a high dusty shelf in the darkest corner of the living room. A few days later, Langdon got a stool, retrieved the rose, and took it back to the store. His father never noticed it was gone. The ping of an elevator pulled Langdon back to the present. Vittoria and Kohler were in front of him, boarding the lift. Langdon hesitated outside the open doors. “Is something wrong?” Kohler asked, sounding more impatient than concerned. “Not at all,” Langdon said, forcing himself toward the cramped carriage. He only used elevators when absolutely necessary. He preferred the more open spaces of stairwells. “Dr. Vetra’s lab is subterranean,” Kohler said. Wonderful, Langdon thought as he stepped across the cleft, feeling an icy wind churn up from the depths of the shaft. The doors closed, and the car began to descend. “Six stories,” Kohler said blankly, like an analytical engine. Langdon pictured the darkness of the empty shaft below them. He tried to block it out by staring at the numbered display of changing floors. ",fiction,suspenseful,"Robert Langdon, Vittoria Vetra, Maximilian Kohler, Bob Brownell, Charles Pratt","NARRATOR: 
The atmosphere in the main atrium was tense and foreboding as LANGDON followed VITTORIA and KOHLER, their footsteps echoing through the empty space. The sound of VITTORIA's controlled breathing filled the air, a stark contrast to the heavy silence that hung between them. LANGDON couldn't help but feel a sense of unease as they approached the elevator, the doors beckoning them into the unknown depths below. The icy wind that rose up from the shaft sent a chill down his spine, and he couldn't shake the feeling that they were descending into darkness. As the elevator began to move, LANGDON's mind raced with thoughts of what awaited them six stories below.

[SFX : FOOTSTEPS]

LANGDON: 
(to VITTORIA) 
Your yoga practice has certainly given you a strong sense of control.

VITTORIA: 
(smiling) 
It's been a great source of strength for me.

V.O. (Vittoria) Vittoria smiled as she thought about the source of strength that had carried her through so many difficult times. But as they approached the elevator, her mind couldn't help but wander to the unknown depths below. The tension in the air was palpable, and she couldn't shake the feeling that something dark and foreboding awaited them.

KOHLER: 
(impatient) 
Can we please focus on the task at hand?

LANGDON: 
(apologetic) 
Of course. I'm sorry, VITTORIA. I didn't mean to distract you.

VITTORIA: 
(understanding) 
It's alright, LANGDON. I appreciate your concern.

V.O. (Vittoria) Vittoria's mind raced with fear and uncertainty as they descended into the unknown depths below. She couldn't shake the feeling that something sinister awaited them, and the tense atmosphere only added to her unease. But she couldn't let Langdon see her fear, so she put on a brave face and reassured him, ""It's alright, LANGDON. I appreciate your concern.""

NARRATOR: 
The elevator doors opened, revealing a dark and ominous shaft. LANGDON hesitated, his fear of enclosed spaces threatening to overtake him.

KOHLER: 
(annoyed) 
Is something wrong?

LANGDON: 
(trying to hide his discomfort) 
Not at all. Just taking a moment to prepare myself.

NARRATOR: 
With a deep breath, LANGDON stepped into the cramped carriage. As the doors closed, he couldn't help but feel a sense of claustrophobia.

KOHLER: 
(blankly) 
Six stories.

NARRATOR: 
The elevator began to descend, and LANGDON's mind raced with thoughts of the darkness below.

LANGDON: 
(to KOHLER) 
Do you ever get used to this?

KOHLER: 
(serious) 
I don't think anyone ever truly gets used to it.

NARRATOR: 
As the elevator continued its descent, LANGDON's thoughts drifted to his own past.

LANGDON: 
(voiceover) 
I remember the funeral mostly, rainy and gray. Two days after my twelfth birthday. The house was filled with gray-suited men from the office, men who squeezed my hand too hard when they shook it. They were all mumbling words like cardiac and stress. My mother joked through teary eyes that she'd always been able to follow the stock market simply by holding my father's hand... his pulse her own private ticker tape.

NARRATOR: 
LANGDON's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of the elevator reaching its destination. The doors opened, revealing a dimly lit hallway.

KOHLER: 
(leading the way) 
Dr. Vetra's lab is just down this hallway.

NARRATOR: 
As they walked, LANGDON couldn't help but feel a sense of admiration for VITTORIA. Her determination and focus were unwavering, despite the grief she carried.

LANGDON: 
(to VITTORIA) 
I'm sorry for your loss, VITTORIA. I know what it's like to lose a parent unexpectedly.

VITTORIA: 
(grateful) 
Thank you, LANGDON. It means a lot.

V.O. (Vittoria) Thank you, LANGDON. It means a lot. I couldn't have done this without you. The tension in this place is suffocating. I can feel the weight of the unknown pressing down on us. But I have to stay strong. For my father. For the truth.

NARRATOR: 
They reached the lab, and VITTORIA opened the door to reveal a large, high-tech room filled with equipment and screens.

VITTORIA: 
(proudly) 
This is where my father and I worked together.

NARRATOR: 
As they began to search for clues, LANGDON couldn't help but feel a sense of familiarity with the lab. He had spent many hours in similar settings, studying ancient symbols and artifacts.

NARRATOR: 
Suddenly, they heard a noise coming from one of the screens.

CHARLES: 
(on screen) 
Hello? Is anyone there?

KOHLER: 
(excitedly) 
That's CHARLES PRATT, one of our top scientists. He must have found something.

V.O. (Kohler) Kohler's heart raced with excitement as they approached the elevator. He couldn't wait to see what Charles Pratt had discovered. The tension in the air only added to his anticipation. As they descended into the unknown depths, he couldn't help but wonder what secrets awaited them.

NARRATOR: 
As they gathered around the screen, CHARLES explained his discovery.

CHARLES: 
(on screen) 
I've found a hidden message in the data. It's a warning.

V.O. (Charles) Charles' heart raced as he processed the hidden message. The warning only added to the tension in the atrium. Vittoria and Kohler's determined strides made him feel small and insignificant. The elevator doors seemed to mock him, daring him to face the unknown. The icy wind only confirmed his fears. What horrors awaited them below?

KOHLER: 
(serious) 
A warning? About what?

CHARLES: 
(on screen) 
I don't know, but it seems to be related to the project my father and I were working on.

NARRATOR: 
As they continued to decipher the message, LANGDON couldn't help but feel a sense of urgency. They needed to find out the truth before it was too late.

LANGDON: 
(to VITTORIA) 
We need to find out what your father was working on. It could be the key to solving this mystery.

VITTORIA: 
(determined) 
I'll show you the files. We need to work together to figure this out.

NARRATOR: 
As they delved deeper into the files, they uncovered a shocking truth that would change everything.

NARRATOR: 
With the help of LANGDON's sharp mind and VITTORIA's expertise, they were able to piece together the puzzle and stop a catastrophic event from occurring.

NARRATOR: 
As they emerged from the lab, LANGDON couldn't help but feel a sense of relief and gratitude towards his new friends.

LANGDON: 
(to VITTORIA and CHARLES) 
Thank you for your help. I couldn't have done it without you.

VITTORIA: 
(smiling) 
It was a team effort.

CHARLES: 
(grateful) 
Thank you for believing in us, LANGDON.

NARRATOR: 
As they parted ways, LANGDON couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. He had once again used his knowledge and determination to uncover the truth and save the day.

"The three children stared at George in the greatest surprise. George stared back at them. ""What do you mean?"" said Dick, at last. ""Kirrin Island can't belong to you. You're just boasting."" ""No, I'm not,"" said George. ""You ask Mother. If you're not going to believe what I say I won't tell you another word more. But I don't tell untruths. I think it's being a coward if you don't tell the truth— and I'm not a coward."" Julian remembered that Aunt Fanny had said that George was absolutely truthful, and he scratched his head and looked at George again. How could she be possibly telling the truth? ""Well, of course we'll believe you if you tell us the truth,"" he said. ""But it does sound a bit extraordinary, you know. Really it does. Children don't usually own islands, even funny little ones like that."" ""It isn't a funny little island,"" said George, fiercely. ""It's lovely. There are rabbits there, as tame as can be— and the big cormorants sit on the other side— and all kinds of gulls go there. The castle is wonderful too, even if it is all in ruins."" ""It sounds fine,"" said Dick. ""How does it belong to you, Georgina?"" George glared at him and didn't answer. ""Sorry,"" said Dick, hastily. ""I didn't mean to call you Georgina. I meant to call you George."" ""Go on, George— tell us how the island belongs to you,"" said Julian, slipping his arm through his sulky little cousin's. She pulled away from him at once. ""Don't do that,"" she said. ""I'm not sure that I want to make friends with you yet."" ""All right, all right,"" said Julian, losing patience. ""Be enemies or anything you like. We don't care. But we like your mother awfully, and we don't want her to think we won't make friends with you."" ""Do you like my mother?"" said George, her bright blue eyes softening a little. ""Yes— she's a dear, isn't she? Well— all right— I'll tell you how Kirrin Castle belongs to me. Come and sit down here in this corner where nobody can hear us."" They all sat down in a sandy corner of the beach. George looked across at the little island in the bay.",fiction,optimistic,"George, Dick, Julian, Aunt Fanny","GEORGE: 
(glaring fiercely) 
What do you mean?

DICK: 
(skeptical) 
Kirrin Island can't belong to you. You're just boasting.

GEORGE: 
(determined) 
No, I'm not. You can ask Mother. I always tell the truth.

JULIAN: 
(scratching his head) 
But how could you possibly own an island?

GEORGE: 
(excitedly) 
Well, it all started when Aunt Fanny inherited the island from her great-aunt. She loved it so much that she decided to pass it down to me.

V.O. (George) ```
Wow, I can't believe it. Aunt Fanny actually left me Kirrin Island? This is incredible! I've always loved this place and now it's mine. I can't wait to show the others all the amazing things on the island. They'll see that I'm not just boasting.

DICK: 
(curious) 
But why you? Why not your mother or your cousins?

GEORGE: 
(serious) 
Because I'm the only one who truly appreciates the island for what it is. It's not just a piece of land to me, it's a magical place full of adventure and wonder.

JULIAN: 
(understanding) 
I see. And what about the castle ruins?

GEORGE: 
(proudly) 
Oh, they're my favorite part. I've explored every nook and cranny, imagining all sorts of adventures that could have taken place there.

V.O. (George) Wow, I can't believe they doubted me. I know every inch of Kirrin Island, and I'm proud of it. I've always been honest, and I'll prove it to them. I can't wait to show them all the amazing adventures we can have there.

DICK: 
(excitedly) 
Can we go visit the island? Please, George?

GEORGE: 
(smiling) 
Of course! I'd love to show you all around. But first, let me tell you about the rabbits and the cormorants and the gulls...

JULIAN: 
(listening intently) 
This island sounds like a dream come true.

V.O. (Julian) Julian couldn't believe his ears. Kirrin Island, a dream come true? He had always heard of its beauty, but never thought he would have the chance to visit. As he listened intently to George's descriptions, he couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder and excitement. This was going to be an adventure of a lifetime.

GEORGE: 
(grinning) 
It is. And I'm so lucky to call it mine.

AUNT FANNY: 
(narrating) 
And so, the children spent the rest of the day exploring Kirrin Island, with George as their fearless guide. They discovered hidden caves, chased after rabbits, and even found a secret treasure chest in the castle ruins. As the sun began to set, they sat on the beach, watching the waves crash against the shore.

[SFX : CRASH]

V.O. (Aunt Fanny) Aunt Fanny watched the children with a smile, grateful for George's adventurous spirit. She remembered her own childhood, exploring the island with her cousins. As the sun set, she couldn't help but feel a twinge of nostalgia. She was glad the children were experiencing the same joy she once did.

GEORGE: 
(looking at her cousins) 
I'm glad you all believe me now. And I'm sorry for being so stubborn earlier.

DICK: 
(smiling) 
It's okay, George. We're just happy to have a new adventure to add to our list.

JULIAN: 
(putting his arm around George) 
And a new friend to add to our family.

V.O. (Julian) Julian couldn't believe it. George was actually telling the truth. She wasn't just boasting. Her conviction was so strong, it was contagious. As she described the island, Julian's doubts faded away. He couldn't wait to visit Kirrin Island and see all the amazing creatures George had described.

AUNT FANNY: 
(narrating) 
And with that, the five of them watched the sunset, grateful for the bond that had formed between them. For on Kirrin Island, anything was possible, even making friends with your enemies.
