"Outside the wall, at the part of the grounds farthest from the public road, were a horse and a light wagon, waiting.  The work of excavation was not difficult: the earth with which the grave had been loosely filled a few hours before offered little resistance and was soon thrown out. Removal of the casket from its box was less easy, but it was taken out, for it was a perquisite of Jess, who carefully unscrewed the cover and laid it aside, exposing the body in black trousers and white shirt. At that instant the air sprang to flame, a cracking shock of thunder shook the stunned world and Henry Armstrong tranquilly sat up. With inarticulate cries the men fled in terror, each in a different direction. For nothing on earth could two of them have been persuaded to return. But Jess was of another breed.  In the grey of the morning the two students, pallid and haggard from anxiety and with the terror of their adventure still beating tumultuously in their blood, met at the medical college.  'You saw it?' cried one.  'God! yes -- what are we to do?'  They went around to the rear of the building, where they saw a horse, attached to a light wagon, hitched to a gatepost near the door of the dissecting-room. Mechanically they entered the room. On a bench in the obscurity sat the negro Jess. He rose, grinning, all eyes and teeth.  'I'm waiting for my pay,' he said.  Stretched naked on a long table lay the body of Henry Armstrong, the head defiled with blood and clay from a blow with a spade.",horror,suspenseful,"Jess, Henry Armstrong, Student 1, Student 2","NARRATOR: 
The night was dark and quiet, broken only by the occasional rustle of leaves and hoot of an owl. Outside the wall, at the farthest part of the grounds, a horse and light wagon waited in eerie silence. Inside, the two students, still shaken from their terrifying encounter, entered the dissecting room. The air was thick with the smell of earth and death, and the only light came from a single flickering lantern. On a bench sat the grinning figure of Jess, waiting for his pay. But what they saw on the long table in the obscurity made their blood run cold - the defiled body of Henry Armstrong, his head caked with blood and clay.

I'm waiting for my pay.

NARRATOR: 
The two students looked at each other, their eyes wide with fear. They knew they had to do something, but they were too scared to move.

NARRATOR: 
The two students were at a loss for what to do. They were trapped in the room with Jess and the resurrected Henry Armstrong.

JESS: 
(smirking) 
You boys look like you've seen a ghost.

Jess chuckled to himself, enjoying the fear he saw in the students' eyes.

NARRATOR: 
The students looked around the room, searching for a way out. But it seemed that Jess had thought of everything.

JESS: 
(laughing) 
You boys really thought you could outsmart me? I've been doing this for years.

NARRATOR: 
Jess stood up from the bench, his eyes glinting in the dim light of the lantern.

JESS: 
(serious) 
Now, I suggest you hand over the money for my services and get out of here before Mr. Armstrong gets hungry.

JESS: 
(angered) 
What do you mean you don't have any money? I did the job, now I want my pay.

V.O. (Jess) ""What do you mean you don't have any money? I did the job, now I want my pay."" Jess thought angrily. The eerie silence and darkness of the night only added to his frustration. But what he saw on the table made his blood run cold. He couldn't wait to get out of here.

NARRATOR: 
Jess's face turned red with anger as he approached the students. But before he could do anything, a loud banging was heard at the door.

POLICE OFFICER: 
(shouting) 
Open up! This is the police!

V.O. (Police Officer) *Open up! This is the police!* 

Why won't they open the door? What could be going on inside? I hope we're not too late. I can't imagine what kind of person could do something so horrible. I need to stay focused and brave, for the sake of justice.

NARRATOR: 
Jess froze, his eyes wide with fear. He knew he had been caught.

JESS: 
(panicked) 
What do we do?

NARRATOR: 
The students opened the door and let the police in. They explained everything that had happened, from their late-night grave robbery to the miraculous resurrection of Henry Armstrong.

POLICE OFFICER: 
(astonished) 
I've never heard anything like this before. But it seems like you boys have learned your lesson. Now, let's get this body back to its grave.

NARRATOR: 
The students and the police carried the body back to the cemetery and reburied it. From that day on, the students never dared to mess with the dead again. And Jess, well, he never worked as a grave digger again.

"The young woman's glance fell upon them with a distant, swift disinterest; then with a lovely smile brightening her countenance and a tender pink tingeing her rounded cheeks, she held out a little gray-gloved hand. When she spoke her voice, full, sweet, and deliberate, proclaimed that its owner was accustomed to speak and be heard.  ""Well, Mr. Easton, if you will make me speak first, I suppose I must. Don't you ever recognize old friends when you meet them in the West?""  The younger man roused himself sharply at the sound of her voice, seemed to struggle with a slight embarrassment which he threw off instantly, and then clasped her fingers with his left hand.  ""It's Miss Fairchild,"" he said, with a smile. ""I'll ask you to excuse the other hand; ""it's otherwise engaged just at present.""  He slightly raised his right hand, bound at the wrist by the shining ""bracelet"" to the left one of his companion. The glad look in the girl's eyes slowly changed to a bewildered horror.

"The children were at play in their play-ground one day, when a herald rode through the town, blowing a trumpet, and crying aloud, ""The King! the King passes by this road to-day. Make ready for the King!"" The children stopped their play, and looked at one another.  ""Did you hear that?"" they said. ""The King is coming. He may look over the wall and see our playground; who knows? We must put it in order.""  The playground was sadly dirty, and in the corners were scraps of paper and broken toys, for these were careless children. But now, one brought a hoe, and another a rake, and a third ran to fetch the wheelbarrow from behind the garden gate. They labored hard, till at length all was clean and tidy.  ""Now it is clean!"" they said; ""but we must make it pretty, too, for kings are used to fine things; maybe he would not notice mere cleanness, for he may have it all the time.""  Then one brought sweet rushes and strewed them on the ground; and others made garlands of oak leaves and pine tassels and hung them on the walls; and the littlest one pulled marigold buds and threw them all about the playground, ""to look like gold,"" he said.  When all was done the playground was so beautiful that the children stood and looked at it, and clapped their hands with pleasure.  ""Let us keep it always like this!"" said the littlest one; and the others cried, ""Yes! yes! that is what we will do.""  They waited all day for the coming of the King, but he never came; only, towards sunset, a man with travel-worn clothes, and a kind, tired face passed along the road, and stopped to look over the wall.",drama,optimistic,"Herald, Children, Man with travel-worn clothes","HERALD:

"Out of the drawer they took about ten little packages of yellow paper, tied with care and arranged one beside the other. They threw these relics on the bed and chose one of them on which the word ""Father"" was written. They opened and read it.  It was one of those old-fashioned letters which one finds in old family desk drawers, those epistles which smell of another century. The first one started: ""My dear,"" another one: ""My beautiful little girl,"" others: ""My dear child,"" or: ""My dear daughter.""

There was a provoking, teasing, maddening smile upon her mouth and in her dark eyes. The would-be-rescuing knight felt the fire of his fiasco burn down to his soul. Here had been his chance, the chance that he had dreamed of; and Momus, and not Cupid, had presided over it. The satyrs in the wood were, no doubt, holding their sides in hilarious, silent laughter. There had been something like vaudeville--say Signor Givens and his funny knockabout act with the stuffed lion.  ""Is that you, Mr. Givens?"" said Josefa, in her deliberate, saccharine contralto. ""You nearly spoilt my shot when you yelled. Did you hurt your head when you fell?""  ""Oh, no,"" said Givens, quietly; ""that didn't hurt."" He stooped ignominiously and dragged his best Stetson hat from under the beast. It was crushed and wrinkled to a fine comedy effect. Then he knelt down and softly stroked the fierce, open-jawed head of the dead lion.  ""Poor old Bill!"" he exclaimed mournfully.  ""What's that?"" asked Josefa, sharply.  ""Of course you didn't know, Miss Josefa,"" said Givens, with an air of one allowing magnanimity to triumph over grief. ""Nobody can blame you. I tried to save him, but I couldn't let you know in time.""  ""Save who?""  ""Why, Bill. I've been looking for him all day. You see, he's been our camp pet for two years.

V.O. (Josefa) ""Ha, that was too easy. Mr. Givens, the fool who couldn't save me. What does he want now? Oh, a confession? A harmless pet? My black eyes don't believe him. But...the peaceful woods, the singing birds...maybe I shouldn't have pulled the trigger. Or maybe I should have aimed for his heart instead.""

JOSEFA: 
(teasingly) 
Oh, did I? (smirks) I'm sorry, Mr. Givens. I didn't know you were here to rescue me.

JOSEFA: 
(confused) 
Who's Bill?

V.O. (Josefa) ```
Who's Bill? I don't even know why I asked. I should be focusing on reloading my gun, not wondering about some random stranger. I can't believe Ripley failed to save me, but he looks so pitiful now. Maybe I should have thought twice before shooting that lion.

JOSEFA: 
(skeptical) 
A camp pet? I find that hard to believe.

JOSEFA: 
(defensive) 
But there's no camp near the White Horse Crossing.

V.O. (Josefa) ""Defensive. Of course I know there's no camp near the White Horse Crossing. But does he think I'm going to let him know that? Not a chance. Let him feel guilty for once. Let him see what it's like to be the one who failed. Serves him right.""

Josefa's black eyes burned steadily upon him, testing his sincerity. Ripley Givens stood his ground, his smooth features set to a pattern of indisputable sorrow.

JOSEFA:

I didn't know. (looks around at the peaceful woods) I should have paid more attention.

V.O. (Josefa) I didn't know. (looks around at the peaceful woods) I should have paid more attention. I can't believe I took down a harmless pet. Maybe I should have listened to Ripley. What have I done? These woods are so peaceful, yet I brought violence. I can't shake off this guilt.

JOSEFA:

I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. Givens. I'll make it up to you somehow.

NARRATOR: 
Ripley Givens stands up, his yellow-brown curls rumpled from all the commotion. He looks at Josefa with a hint of regret in his eyes.

Thank you, Mr. Givens. I appreciate it.

The two stand in silence, looking at each other with newfound understanding. The sun continues to set, casting a warm glow on the woods and the two characters in it.

NARRATOR: 
And so, the unlikely duo stood in the peaceful woods, brought together by a misunderstanding and a tragic loss. But in the end, they found a common ground and a newfound respect for each other. As night falls and the stars twinkle above, they both know that this encounter will forever be etched in their memories.

"When Hughie came in he found Trevor putting the finishing touches to a wonderful life-size picture of a beggar-man. The beggar himself was standing on a raised platform in a corner of the studio. He was a wizened old man, with a face like wrinkled parchment, and a most piteous expression. Over his shoulders was flung a coarse brown cloak, all tears and tatters; his thick boots were patched and cobbled, and with one hand he leant on a rough stick, while with the other he held out his battered hat for alms.  'What an amazing model!' whispered Hughie, as he shook hands with his friend.  'An amazing model?' shouted Trevor at the top of his voice; 'I should think so! Such beggars as he are not to be met with every day. A trouvaille, mort cher; a living Velasquez! My stars! what an etching Rembrandt would have made of him!'  'Poor old chap! said Hughie, 'how miserable he looks! But I suppose, to you painters, his face is his fortune?'  'Certainly,' replied Trevor, 'you don't want a beggar to look happy, do you?'  'How much does a model get for sitting?' asked Hughie, as he found himself a comfortable seat on a divan.  'A shilling an hour.'  'And how much do you get for your picture, Alan?'  'Oh, for this I get two thousand!'  'Pounds?'  'Guineas. Painters, poets, and physicians always get guineas.'  'Well, I think the model should have a percentage,' cried Hughie, laughing; 'they work quite as hard as you do.'  'Nonsense, nonsense! Why, look at the trouble of laying on the paint alone, and standing all day long at one's easel! It's all very well, Hughie, for you to talk, but I assure you that there are moments when Art almost attains to the dignity of manual labour. But you mustn't chatter; I'm very busy. Smoke a cigarette, and keep quiet.'  After some time the servant came in, and told Trevor that the frame-maker wanted to speak to him.",comedy,humorous ,"Hughie, Trevor, Beggar-man, Servant, Frame-maker","NARRATOR:

Hughie enters Trevor's studio and is immediately struck by the sight of Trevor putting the finishing touches on a life-size picture of a beggar-man.

HUGHIE: 
Wow, Trevor, this is amazing!

TREVOR: 
(smiling) 
Thank you, Hughie. I've been working on it for weeks.

V.O. (Trevor) ""Hughie seems impressed. Maybe I can finally prove my worth as an artist. But what about the model? He looks so miserable. Does he deserve a cut? No, Trevor, painting is not as hard as manual labor. Stop being selfish. Focus on the painting.""

HUGHIE: 
What's the secret to your success?

TREVOR: 
(patting the model's shoulder) 
It's all thanks to my amazing model here.

NARRATOR: 
The model, a wizened old man with a face like wrinkled parchment, stands on a raised platform, dressed in a coarse brown cloak.

HUGHIE: 
(puzzled) 
But he looks so miserable.

TREVOR: 
(serious) 
Of course he does. Beggars are meant to look miserable. It adds to the overall effect.

HUGHIE: 
(whispering) 
But doesn't he get tired of standing all day?

TREVOR: 
(laughing) 
Oh, he gets paid for it. A shilling an hour.

HUGHIE: 
(surprised) 
That's not much.

TREVOR: 
(grinning) 
But I get two thousand guineas for the painting.

HUGHIE: 
(in disbelief) 
Two thousand guineas? That's a lot of money!

TREVOR: 
(nodding) 
Painters, poets, and physicians always get guineas.

HUGHIE: 
(smiling) 
Well, I think the model should get a percentage. He works just as hard as you do.

TREVOR: 
(shaking his head) 
Nonsense, Hughie. Painting is almost as hard as manual labor.

NARRATOR: 
Just then, the servant enters and interrupts their conversation.

SERVANT: 
(excitedly) 
Master Trevor, the frame-maker is here. He wants to speak to you about the frame for the painting.

TREVOR: 
(excitedly) 
Perfect timing! I can't wait to see what he's come up with.

V.O. (Trevor) ```
Wow, this is amazing! Hughie was right, Trevor's work truly is exceptional. I can't wait to see the finished piece, it's going to be worth every penny. But I can't help feeling a twinge of guilt for the model. Maybe I should speak up, but Trevor seems so confident...

NARRATOR: 
The frame-maker, a skilled craftsman, enters the studio and shows Trevor his creation.

TREVOR: 
(amazed) 
It's perfect. You truly are a master at your craft.

NARRATOR: 
As Trevor and the frame-maker discuss the details of the frame, Hughie takes a seat on the divan and lights a cigarette.

HUGHIE: 
(smiling) 
This is the life, isn't it?

TREVOR: 
(grinning) 
You could say that. But don't get too comfortable, Hughie. I still have a lot of work to do.

NARRATOR: 
Hughie takes a puff of his cigarette and looks around the studio, taking in the atmosphere.

HUGHIE: 
(voiceover) 
I may not be a painter like Trevor, but I can appreciate the hard work and dedication that goes into creating a masterpiece. And who knows, maybe one day I'll be able to afford a painting of my own.

V.O. (Hughie) I never realized how much work goes into painting. Trevor's dedication is impressive. I feel sorry for the model, but Trevor insists that beggars are meant to look miserable. Maybe one day I'll be able to afford a painting of my own. But for now, I'll just appreciate the art.

NARRATOR: 
As the frame-maker and Trevor continue their discussion, Hughie sits back and enjoys the company of his friend and the amazing model that has brought their world to life. The end.

"He seemed unwilling to leave anything to the imagination of a casual observer, and his talk grew presently personal and introspective.  ""I don't know how it is,"" he told his friend, ""I'm not much over forty, but I seem to have settled down into a deep groove of elderly middle-age. My sister shows the same tendency. We like everything to be exactly in its accustomed place; we like things to happen exactly at their appointed times; we like everything to be usual, orderly, punctual, methodical, to a hair's breadth, to a minute. It distresses and upsets us if it is not so. For instance, to take a very trifling matter, a thrush has built its nest year after year in the catkin- tree on the lawn; this year, for no obvious reason, it is building in the ivy on the garden wall. We have said very little about it, but I think we both feel that the change is unnecessary, and just a little irritating.""  ""Perhaps,"" said the friend, ""it is a different thrush.""  ""We have suspected that,"" said J. P. Huddle, ""and I think it gives us even more cause for annoyance. We don't feel that we want a change of thrush at our time of life; and yet, as I have said, we have scarcely reached an age when these things should make themselves seriously felt.""  ""What you want,"" said the friend, ""is an Unrest-cure.""  ""An Unrest-cure? I've never heard of such a thing.""  ""You've heard of Rest-cures for people who've broken down under stress of too much worry and strenuous living; well, you're suffering from overmuch repose and placidity, and you need the opposite kind of treatment.""  ""But where would one go for such a thing?""  ""Well, you might stand as an Orange candidate for Kilkenny, or do a course of district visiting in one of the Apache quarters of Paris, or give lectures in Berlin to prove that most of Wagner's music was written by Gambetta; and there's always the interior of Morocco to travel in. But, to be really effective, the Unrest-cure ought to be tried in the home. How you would do it I haven't the faintest idea.""",comedy,humorous ,"J. P. Huddle, Friend","NARRATOR:

It's the opposite of a Rest-cure. You know, for people who are overworked and stressed. But in your case, you need a bit of excitement.

"Filled with amazement and terror by this apparition of a horseman in the sky--half believing himself the chosen scribe of some new Apocalypse, the officer was overcome by the intensity of his emotions; his legs failed him and he fell. Almost at the same instant he heard a crashing sound in the trees--a sound that died without an echo--and all was still.  The officer rose to his feet, trembling. The familiar sensation of an abraded shin recalled his dazed faculties. Pulling himself together he ran rapidly obliquely away from the cliff to a point distant from its foot; thereabout he expected to find his man; and thereabout he naturally failed. In the fleeting instant of his vision his imagination had been so wrought upon by the apparent grace and ease and intention of the marvelous performance that it did not occur to him that the line of march of arial cavalry is directly downward, and that he could find the objects of his search at the very foot of the cliff. A half-hour later he returned to camp.  This officer was a wise man; he knew better than to tell an incredible truth. He said nothing of what he had seen. But when the commander asked him if in his scout he had learned anything of advantage to the expedition he answered:  ""Yes, sir; there is no road leading down into this valley from the southward.""  The commander, knowing better, smiled.  After firing his shot, Private Carter Druse reloaded his rifle and resumed his watch. Ten minutes had hardly passed when a Federal sergeant crept cautiously to him on hands and knees. Druse neither turned his head nor looked at him, but lay without motion or sign of recognition.  ""Did you fire?"" the sergeant whispered.  ""Yes.""  ""At what?""  ""A horse. It was standing on yonder rock--pretty far out. You see it is no longer there. It went over the cliff.""  The man's face was white, but he showed no other sign of emotion. Having answered, he turned away his eyes and said no more. The sergeant did not understand.  ""See here, Druse,"" he said, after a moment's silence, ""it's no use making a mystery. I order you to report. Was there anybody on the horse?""  ""Yes.""  ""Well?""  ""My father.""  The sergeant rose to his feet and walked away. ""Good God!"" he said.",drama,suspenseful,"Officer, commander, Private Carter Druse, Federal sergeant","COMMANDER:

"That night the city wore the mask of a capital. The five young men strolled along Stephen's Green in a faint cloud of aromatic smoke. They talked loudly and gaily and their cloaks dangled from their shoulders. The people made way for them. At the corner of Grafton Street a short fat man was putting two handsome ladies on a car in charge of another fat man. The car drove off and the short fat man caught sight of the party.  ""Andre.""  ""It's Farley!""  A torrent of talk followed. Farley was an American. No one knew very well what the talk was about. Villona and Riviere were the noisiest, but all the men were excited. They got up on a car, squeezing themselves together amid much laughter. They drove by the crowd, blended now into soft colours, to a music of merry bells. They took the train at Westland Row and in a few seconds, as it seemed to Jimmy, they were walking out of Kingstown Station. The ticket-collector saluted Jimmy; he was an old man:  ""Fine night, sir!""  It was a serene summer night; the harbour lay like a darkened mirror at their feet. They proceeded towards it with linked arms, singing Cadet Roussel in chorus, stamping their feet at every:  ""Ho! Ho! Hohe, vraiment!""  They got into a rowboat at the slip and made out for the American's yacht. There was to be supper, music, cards. Villona said with conviction:  ""It is delightful!""  There was a yacht piano in the cabin. Villona played a waltz for Farley and Riviere, Farley acting as cavalier and Riviere as lady. Then an impromptu square dance, the men devising original figures. What merriment! Jimmy took his part with a will; this was seeing life, at least. Then Farley got out of breath and cried ""Stop!"" A man brought in a light supper, and the young men sat down to it for form's sake. They drank, however: it was Bohemian. They drank Ireland, England, France, Hungary, the United States of America. Jimmy made a speech, a long speech, Villona saying: ""Hear! hear!"" whenever there was a pause. There was a great clapping of hands when he sat down. It must have been a good speech.

I have just returned from tending to my fever patients. I am exhausted and I gave strict orders not to be disturbed. Now, leave me be.

NARRATOR: 
Nellie's heart sank as she realized the doctor would not help her. But she refused to give up.

NELLIE: 
But doctor, my husband is gravely ill. He needs your help. Please, I beg of you.

STEPAN LUKITCH: 
(sighs) 
Fine. I will come, but it will cost you extra.

NARRATOR: 
With a glimmer of hope, Nellie led the doctor to her home, where her husband lay in agony. The doctor examined him, and with his expertise, he was able to save him. Nellie's husband made a full recovery, and the village praised the doctor for his skill. But Nellie knew the truth. It was her determination and unwavering love that saved her husband's life.

"It was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season, that I encountered my friend. He accosted me with excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much. The man wore motley. He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him that I thought I should never have done wringing his hand.  I said to him --""My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met. How remarkably well you are looking to-day. But I have received a pipe of what passes for Amontillado, and I have my doubts.""  ""How?"" said he. ""Amontillado, A pipe? Impossible! And in the middle of the carnival!""  ""I have my doubts,"" I replied; ""and I was silly enough to pay the full Amontillado price without consulting you in the matter. You were not to be found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.""  ""Amontillado!""  ""I have my doubts.""  ""Amontillado!""  ""And I must satisfy them.""  ""Amontillado!""  ""As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchresi. If any one has a critical turn it is he. He will tell me --""  ""Luchresi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.""  ""And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your own.  ""Come, let us go.""  ""Whither?""  ""To your vaults.""  ""My friend, no; I will not impose upon your good nature. I perceive you have an engagement. Luchresi--""  ""I have no engagement; --come.""  ""My friend, no. It is not the engagement, but the severe cold with which I perceive you are afflicted. The vaults are insufferably damp. They are encrusted with nitre.""  ""Let us go, nevertheless. The cold is merely nothing. Amontillado! You have been imposed upon. And as for Luchresi, he cannot distinguish Sherry from Amontillado.""  Thus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm; and putting on a mask of black silk and drawing a roquelaire closely about my person, I suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.",horror,mysterious,"Narrator, Fortunato, Luchresi","NARRATOR: 
(voiceover) 
As dusk settles over the carnival grounds, the air is thick with the scent of fried food and the sounds of merry laughter. But amidst the revelry, something sinister lurks. It is during this time of supreme madness that our protagonist encounters his friend, the man in motley.

FORTUNATO: 
(laughing and stumbling) 
My dear friend! How wonderful to see you amidst all this madness. Have you been enjoying the carnival?

V.O. (Fortunato) FORTUNATO: My dear friend! How wonderful to see you amidst all this madness. Have you been enjoying the carnival?

*laughing and stumbling*
FORTUNATO's inner monologue: What a fool I am, stumbling around in this drunken state. But I cannot let Fortunato see my doubts about the Amontillado. I must play along with his excessive warmth and pretend to enjoy the carnival. But something sinister lurks beneath the surface, and I cannot shake this feeling of dread.

NARRATOR: 
(smiling) 
Indeed, it has been quite an adventure. But I must admit, I have a pressing matter to attend to. I have received a pipe of what passes for Amontillado, but I have my doubts.

FORTUNATO: 
(concerned) 
Doubts? Impossible! And in the middle of the carnival?

V.O. (Fortunato) Doubts? Impossible! And in the middle of the carnival? Fortunato's words echo in my mind, but I can't shake off this feeling of unease. The carnival may be a perfect distraction, but it only adds to the madness. I must be careful. The Amontillado may not be my only concern tonight.

NARRATOR: 
(regretful) 
Yes, I was foolish enough to pay the full Amontillado price without consulting you. I could not find you and I feared I would lose a bargain.

FORTUNATO: 
(outraged) 
Amontillado! How dare they swindle you. We must go to your vaults and taste this wine immediately.

NARRATOR: 
(skeptical) 
I am not sure that is wise, my friend. The vaults are damp and encrusted with nitre. It is not a pleasant place to be.

FORTUNATO: 
(determined) 
Nonsense! I have been to your vaults before and it was perfectly fine. Besides, I am an expert in wine. I will be able to tell if it is truly Amontillado or not.

NARRATOR: 
(smiling) 
You are right, as always. Let us go then, but I must warn you, it is quite cold outside.

FORTUNATO: 
(jovially) 
Do not worry, my friend. The cold will not stop us from enjoying a fine wine.

V.O. (Fortunato) As we walked through the carnival, I couldn't shake off the feeling of unease. Fortunato's jovial demeanor only heightened my suspicions. But I couldn't let the cold stop me from enjoying a good wine. Maybe I'm just being paranoid. But what if he's up to something?

NARRATOR: 
(voiceover) 
And so, with Fortunato's arm linked with mine, we made our way through the crowded streets towards the palazzo. The air was filled with the sounds of laughter and music, but my mind was consumed with thoughts of the Amontillado and what awaited us in the vaults.

LUCRESI: 
(smirking) 
Well, well, well. What do we have here? The great Fortunato, accompanied by his loyal friend, the Narrator.

V.O. (Lucresi) ""Ha, Fortunato, you pompous fool. Your drunkenness and foolishness will lead you straight to your downfall. But will it be worth the satisfaction? The carnival's joviality only masks the darkness lurking beneath. I must proceed with caution, for the Amontillado will surely be my greatest triumph.""

FORTUNATO: 
(defensive) 
What business is it of yours, Luchresi?

LUCRESI: 
(amused) 
Oh, no business at all. I simply couldn't resist the opportunity to see the great Fortunato in his natural element - the carnival.

NARRATOR: 
(smiling) 
I must say, Luchresi, you do seem to have a critical eye for fine wines.

LUCRESI: 
(proudly) 
Why, thank you, my dear Narrator. I take great pride in my refined taste.

FORTUNATO: 
(dismissive) 
Bah! Your taste may be fine, but it is no match for mine.

LUCRESI: 
(mocking) 
Is that so? Well, I suppose we shall see about that.

V.O. (Lucresi) ""Is that so? Well, I suppose we shall see about that. Ha! What a fool, trusting in the Amontillado. But amidst the revelry, something sinister lurks. And it's not just the carnival. Fortunato, my friend, what have you gotten us into?""

NARRATOR: 
(voiceover) 
And so, with Luchresi now joining us, we made our way towards the vaults. The cold air seemed to grow colder with each step, and the sound of our footsteps echoed through the silent streets. As we reached the palazzo, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. What would become of us in the damp and dark depths of the vaults? Only time would tell.

"The Skin Horse had lived longer in the nursery than any of the others. He was so old that his brown coat was bald in patches and showed the seams underneath, and most of the hairs in his tail had been pulled out to string bead necklaces. He was wise, for he had seen a long succession of mechanical toys arrive to boast and swagger, and by-and-by break their mainsprings and pass away, and he knew that they were only toys, and would never turn into anything else. For nursery magic is very strange and wonderful, and only those playthings that are old and wise and experienced like the Skin Horse understand all about it.  ""What is REAL?"" asked the Rabbit one day, when they were lying side by side near the nursery fender, before Nana came to tidy the room. ""Does it mean having things that buzz inside you and a stick-out handle?""  ""Real isn't how you are made,"" said the Skin Horse. ""It's a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real.""  ""Does it hurt?"" asked the Rabbit.  ""Sometimes,"" said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful. ""When you are Real you don't mind being hurt.""  ""Does it happen all at once, like being wound up,"" he asked, ""or bit by bit?""  ""It doesn't happen all at once,"" said the Skin Horse. ""You become. It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand.""  ""I suppose you are Real?"" said the Rabbit. And then he wished he had not said it, for he thought the Skin Horse might be sensitive. But the Skin Horse only smiled.",fiction,optimistic,"Skin Horse, Rabbit, Nana","NARRATOR:

(sighs) 
Oh, how the time has flown.

(curious) 
What do you mean?

SKIN HORSE: 
(smiling) 
Well, I've seen a long succession of mechanical toys come and go. They arrive boasting and swaggering, but eventually they break and pass away.

NARRATOR: 
The Skin Horse knew that these toys were only temporary, and that there was something more to be gained in the nursery.

RABBIT: 
(puzzled) 
What's that?

(serene) 
Nursery magic, my dear Rabbit. Only those playthings that are old and wise and experienced understand all about it.

The Rabbit listened intently, eager to learn more.

RABBIT: 
(innocently) 
But what is REAL?

SKIN HORSE: 
(thoughtful) 
Real isn't how you are made. It's a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real.

The Rabbit's eyes widened in wonder.

RABBIT: 
(excited) 
Does that mean I can become Real too?

V.O. (Rabbit) ""Wow, the Skin Horse has seen so much in this nursery. I can't believe he's been here longer than anyone else. He looks old and worn, but he's still so wise. I wonder what his secret to becoming Real is. Maybe one day, I'll know too.""

SKIN HORSE: 
(smiling) 
Of course, my dear Rabbit.

NARRATOR: 
The Rabbit was filled with hope, but also a little worried.

RABBIT: 
(concerned) 
Does it hurt?

V.O. (Rabbit) Does it hurt? The Skin Horse's words echoed in my mind. I'm just a toy, I can't feel pain. But his concerned tone made me feel something else - a longing to be real like him. To be loved by a child, to have a purpose. Maybe one day I'll be more than just a stuffed rabbit.

SKIN HORSE: 
(truthful) 
Sometimes. When you are Real, you don't mind being hurt.

NARRATOR: 
The Rabbit thought about this for a moment.

RABBIT: 
(curious) 
Does it happen all at once, like being wound up, or bit by bit?

SKIN HORSE: 
(serious) 
It doesn't happen all at once. You become. It takes a long time.

NARRATOR: 
The Skin Horse looked around the nursery, his wise eyes taking in all the toys.

SKIN HORSE: 
(understanding) 
That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand.

(smiling) 
I am, my dear Rabbit. And you will be too, in time.

V.O. (Skin Horse) I may be old and worn, but I am Real. The love of a child has made me so. And now, dear Rabbit, you too will experience the joy of being Real. Our time in the nursery may be coming to an end, but the memories we have made will last forever.

The Rabbit was filled with hope and excitement, knowing that one day he would also become Real. And as they lay side by side near the nursery fender, the Skin Horse continued to share his wisdom with the curious Rabbit.

"I walked and walked along the cold wet sand, making my chattering teeth warble in honour of cold and hunger, when suddenly, as I was carefully searching for something to eat behind one of the empty crates, I perceived behind it, crouching on the ground, a figure in woman's clothes dank with the rain and clinging fast to her stooping shoulders. Standing over her, I watched to see what she was doing. It appeared that she was digging a trench in the sand with her hands--digging away under one of the crates.  ""Why are you doing that?"" I asked, crouching down on my heels quite close to her.  She gave a little scream and was quickly on her legs again. Now that she stood there staring at me, with her wide-open grey eyes full of terror, I perceived that it was a girl of my own age, with a very pleasant face embellished unfortunately by three large blue marks. This spoilt her, although these blue marks had been distributed with a remarkable sense of proportion, one at a time, and all were of equal size--two under the eyes, and one a little bigger on the forehead just over the bridge of the nose. This symmetry was evidently the work of an artist well inured to the business of spoiling the human physiognomy.  The girl looked at me, and the terror in her eyes gradually died out... She shook the sand from her hands, adjusted her cotton head-gear, cowered down, and said:  ""I suppose you too want something to eat? Dig away then! My hands are tired. Over there""--she nodded her head in the direction of a booth--""there is bread for certain ... and sausages too... That booth is still carrying on business.""  I began to dig. She, after waiting a little and looking at me, sat down beside me and began to help me.  We worked in silence. I cannot say now whether I thought at that moment of the criminal code, of morality, of proprietorship, and all the other things about which, in the opinion of many experienced persons, one ought to think every moment of one's life. Wishing to keep as close to the truth as possible, I must confess that apparently I was so deeply engaged in digging under the crate that I completely forgot about everything else except this one thing: What could be inside that crate?

Why are you doing that?

V.O. (Girl) ""Why are you doing that?"" I ask, my voice trembling with fear. I can't believe what I'm seeing. This woman looks like she's been through hell, and yet here she is, digging in the sand.

"Olenka, the daughter of the retired collegiate assessor, Plemyanniakov, was sitting in her back porch, lost in thought. It was hot, the flies were persistent and teasing, and it was pleasant to reflect that it would soon be evening. Dark rainclouds were gathering from the east, and bringing from time to time a breath of moisture in the air.  Kukin, who was the manager of an open-air theatre called the Tivoli, and who lived in the lodge, was standing in the middle of the garden looking at the sky.  ""Again!"" he observed despairingly. ""It's going to rain again! Rain every day, as though to spite me. I might as well hang myself! It's ruin! Fearful losses every day.""  He flung up his hands, and went on, addressing Olenka:  ""There! that's the life we lead, Olga Semyonovna. It's enough to make one cry. One works and does one's utmost, one wears oneself out, getting no sleep at night, and racks one's brain what to do for the best. And then what happens? To begin with, one's public is ignorant, boorish. I give them the very best operetta, a dainty masque, first rate music-hall artists. But do you suppose that's what they want! They don't understand anything of that sort. They want a clown; what they ask for is vulgarity. And then look at the weather! Almost every evening it rains. It started on the tenth of May, and it's kept it up all May and June. It's simply awful! The public doesn't come, but I've to pay the rent just the same, and pay the artists.""  The next evening the clouds would gather again, and Kukin would say with an hysterical laugh:  ""Well, rain away, then! Flood the garden, drown me! Damn my luck in this world and the next! Let the artists have me up! Send me to prison! -- to Siberia! -- the scaffold! Ha, ha, ha!""  And next day the same thing.  Olenka listened to Kukin with silent gravity, and sometimes tears came into her eyes. In the end his misfortunes touched her; she grew to love him. He was a small thin man, with a yellow face, and curls combed forward on his forehead. He spoke in a thin tenor; as he talked his mouth worked on one side, and there was always an expression of despair on his face; yet he aroused a deep and genuine affection in her.

"This did not long sustain his drooping spirit. He was mentally adrift upon the Hints and Helps to Young Men in Business and Social Relations, which had suggested to him his present enterprise, when the appearance of a second youth, taller and broader than himself, with a shock of light curling hair and a crop of freckles that advertised a rich soil threw him a lifeline. He put his thumbs to his lips and whistled in a peculiarly ear-splitting way. The two boys had sat on the same bench at Sunday-school not three hours before; yet what a change had come over the world for one of them since then!  ""Hello! Where you goin', Ab?"" asked the newcomer, gruffly.  ""Callin',"" replied the boy in the collar, laconically, but with carefully averted gaze.  ""On the girls?"" inquired the other, awestruck.

""Do you reckon you could?"" he debated, trotting along by the irresponsive Jilton boy.  ""Run home to your mother,"" growled the originator of the plan, savagely. ""You ain't old enough to call on girls; anybody can see that; but I am, and I'm going to call on Champe Claiborne.""  Again the name acted as a spur on Ross. ""With your collar and boots all dirty?"" he jeered. ""They won't know you're callin'.""  The boy in the road stopped short in his dusty tracks. He was an intense creature, and he whitened at the tragic insinuation, longing for the wholesome stay and companionship of freckle-faced Ross.

V.O. (Ross) ""Damn it, Abner always has some kind of harebrained scheme. But I can't help but be curious. What does he have up his sleeve this time? And why does he look so pleased with himself? Ugh, I should be mad at him for dragging me along, but I can't resist his mischievous grin.""

NARRATOR: 
The two boys, Abner and Ross, were always getting into mischief. But today, they had a different kind of mischief in mind. Abner had a crush on the beautiful and charming Champe Claiborne, and he was determined to call on her. However, with his dirty collar and boots, he was having second thoughts. Luckily, his loyal friend Ross had a plan to help him out.

ABNER: 
(proudly) 
Alright, I think I'm ready. How do I look?

V.O. (Abner) ""I look good, real good. Maybe even better than Ross. I know Champe will be impressed. But why did he have to mention my dirty clothes? Maybe I should have changed. No, I can't back down now. I've got this. I can do it.""

ROSS: 
(smiling) 
Like a million bucks. Now let's go ring that doorbell.

CHAMPE: 
(smiling) 
Well, hello boys. What brings you here?

ABNER: 
(nervously) 
I, uh, just wanted to say hi. How are you doing?

CHAMPE: 
(amused) 
I'm doing well, thank you. And you?

ABNER: 
(feeling silly) 
I'm doing great. I just wanted to call on you, that's all.

V.O. (Abner) I can't believe I'm doing this. Champe Claiborne is going to think I'm a fool. But I have to do it. I have to prove to Ross that I can do anything. Even if it means walking down this dusty road with my Sunday-school clothes covered in dirt. I just hope she doesn't mind.

CHAMPE: 
(trying not to laugh) 
Well, I appreciate the gesture. But I'm afraid my father wouldn't approve of you calling on me just yet.

ABNER: 
(disappointed) 
Oh.

V.O. (Abner) Oh. I thought she'd be impressed by my new Sunday suit. Now Ross is laughing at my dirt. But I can't let him see me falter. I'll show him. Champe will see that I'm not just a farm boy. I'll make her laugh, and she'll forget all about my clothes.

ROSS: 
(smirking) 
Don't worry, Abner. We'll come back when you're old enough.

CHAMPE: 
(smiling) 
Yes, please do. I'll be waiting.

NARRATOR: 
As the boys walked away, Abner couldn't help but feel a little embarrassed. But he also felt a sense of accomplishment. He had faced his fears and called on the girl he liked. And with Ross by his side, he knew he could face anything.

ABNER: 
(grinning) 
Well, that didn't go as planned.

ROSS: 
(laughing) 
Nope, but it was still fun.

V.O. (Ross) Nope, but it was still fun. Ross thought to himself, trying not to laugh at Abner's ridiculous plan. He couldn't help but admire Abner's confidence, even if it was misguided. But when Ross noticed Abner's dirty clothes, he couldn't resist making a joke. Now, he's not sure if he's ruined everything.

ABNER: 
(looking at Ross) 
Thanks for your help, buddy.

ROSS: 
(grinning) 
Anytime, Ab. That's what friends are for.

NARRATOR: 
And with that, the two boys continued on their journey, ready for whatever mischief they could get into next.

"Mr. Pneumonia was not what you would call a chivalric old gentleman. A mite of a little woman with blood thinned by California zephyrs was hardly fair game for the red-fisted, short-breathed old duffer. But Johnsy he smote; and she lay, scarcely moving, on her painted iron bedstead, looking through the small Dutch window-panes at the blank side of the next brick house.  One morning the busy doctor invited Sue into the hallway with a shaggy, gray eyebrow.  ""She has one chance in - let us say, ten,"" he said, as he shook down the mercury in his clinical thermometer. "" And that chance is for her to want to live. This way people have of lining-u on the side of the undertaker makes the entire pharmacopoeia look silly. Your little lady has made up her mind that she's not going to get well. Has she anything on her mind?""  ""She - she wanted to paint the Bay of Naples some day."" said Sue.  ""Paint? - bosh! Has she anything on her mind worth thinking twice - a man for instance?""  ""A man?"" said Sue, with a jew's-harp twang in her voice. ""Is a man worth - but, no, doctor; there is nothing of the kind.""  ""Well, it is the weakness, then,"" said the doctor. ""I will do all that science, so far as it may filter through my efforts, can accomplish. But whenever my patient begins to count the carriages in her funeral procession I subtract 50 per cent from the curative power of medicines. If you will get her to ask one question about the new winter styles in cloak sleeves I will promise you a one-in-five chance for her, instead of one in ten.""  After the doctor had gone Sue went into the workroom and cried a Japanese napkin to a pulp. Then she swaggered into Johnsy's room with her drawing board, whistling ragtime.  Johnsy lay, scarcely making a ripple under the bedclothes, with her face toward the window. Sue stopped whistling, thinking she was asleep.  She arranged her board and began a pen-and-ink drawing to illustrate a magazine story. Young artists must pave their way to Art by drawing pictures for magazine stories that young authors write to pave their way to Literature.  As Sue was sketching a pair of elegant horseshow riding trousers and a monocle of the figure of the hero, an Idaho cowboy, she heard a low sound, several times repeated.",drama,optimistic,"Mr. Pneumonia, Johnsy, Sue, Doctor, Behrman","NARRATOR: 
In a small, dimly lit hospital room, Johnsy lies in her bed, her frail body barely making a ripple under the covers. Her face is turned toward the window, as if searching for something. The only sound in the room is Sue's pen scratching against her drawing board, creating a sketch of an elegant cowboy. The air smells of disinfectant and medicine, and the gentle beeping of machines can be heard in the background. Sue's voice echoes through the room as she whistles a cheerful tune, trying to lift Johnsy's spirits. Despite the seriousness of the situation, there is a sense of hope and optimism in the room, as Sue refuses to give up on her friend's recovery.

SUE: 
(crying) 
Oh Johnsy, please don't give up. You have so much to live for.

V.O. (Sue) Oh Johnsy, please don't give up. You have so much to live for. I can't lose you. I can't imagine my life without you. You're my best friend, my confidant, my sister. You can't leave me here alone. I'll do anything to make you better. Please, please fight for your life. I need you.

JOHNSY: 
(weakly) 
I'm just so tired, Sue. I can't fight Mr. Pneumonia anymore.

SUE: 
(determined) 
You can't let him win. You have to keep fighting.

V.O. (Sue) I won't let him win. I'll keep fighting for Johnsy's sake. She needs me now more than ever. The machines beep in the background, a constant reminder of her fragility. But I won't lose hope. I'll keep drawing, keep whistling, keep fighting until she's better.

JOHNSY: 
(resigned) 
But what's the point? I'll never be able to paint again.

SUE: 
(inspirational) 
You don't know that. The doctor said you have a chance. And you have so many other things to live for, like... men!

V.O. (Sue) SUE: (whispering to herself) You have to stay strong, Johnsy. You can't give up now. The doctor said there's a chance. And I won't let you give up on life, not when there's so much to live for. You have to fight, for yourself, for us, for love.

JOHNSY: 
(skeptical) 
Men? What do I care about men?

SUE: 
(smirking) 
Well, you never know. Maybe there's a handsome doctor out there waiting for you.

V.O. (Sue) Wow, Sue. Always the optimist. But let's be real, I highly doubt there's a handsome doctor in this depressing hospital. But I guess anything's possible. I'll keep my eyes peeled, just in case. Anything to make Johnsy smile again.

JOHNSY: 
(smiling) 
You really think so?

SUE: 
(serious) 
I know so. And I won't rest until you find him.

NARRATOR: 
Sue's words seemed to have a positive effect on Johnsy. She began to sit up in bed, her eyes filled with renewed determination.

JOHNSY: 
(excited) 
You know what? I do want to live. I want to paint the Bay of Naples and find a handsome doctor to share it with.

[SFX : BAY]

SUE: 
(happy tears) 
That's the spirit, Johnsy!

V.O. (Sue) SUE: That's the spirit, Johnsy!

(Inner monologue)

SUE: Seeing Johnsy's tears of happiness fills me with so much joy. It's been a tough journey, but I refuse to let her lose hope. I'll keep whistling and sketching, anything to keep her spirits up. We'll get through this together.

NARRATOR: 
Just then, the doctor entered the room, his shaggy gray eyebrows furrowed with concern.

DOCTOR: 
(gruff) 
What's all this commotion about?

SUE: 
(excited) 
Johnsy wants to live, doctor! She wants to paint and find love and...

V.O. (Sue) Wow, Johnsy is really fighting for her life. I can see it in her eyes, she's determined to make it through this. She's not ready to give up on her dreams and neither am I. I'll do whatever it takes to help her see the beauty and love in this world.

DOCTOR: 
(interrupting) 
Slow down, Sue. Let me take a look at her.

NARRATOR: 
The doctor examined Johnsy, a small smile forming on his face.

DOCTOR: 
(proudly) 
Her fever is gone. She's going to make it.

JOHNSY: 
(tearfully) 
Thank you, doctor.

V.O. (Johnsy) Thank you, doctor. I can't believe I've been so sick. I never thought I'd end up in a hospital bed like this. But Sue's here, and she won't let me give up. She's drawing again, that silly cowboy. It's nice to hear her whistling. Maybe I'll get through this after all.

DOCTOR: 
(smiling) 
I didn't do anything. It was all you, Johnsy. Your will to live is what saved you.

BEHRMAN: 
(entering) 
What's all the fuss about?

SUE: 
(excited) 
Johnsy is going to be okay, Behrman!

BEHRMAN: 
(relieved) 
Thank goodness. I couldn't bear to lose her.

NARRATOR: 
Behrman had been a silent but supportive presence throughout Johnsy's illness, and his words brought tears to her eyes.

JOHNSY: 
(gratefully) 
Thank you, Behrman. You've been such a good friend to me.

V.O. (Johnsy) ```JOHNSY```: Thank you, Behrman. You've been such a good friend to me. I don't know what I would do without you and Sue. I wish I could tell you how much your support means to me. I hope I can get better soon and repay your kindness.

(teasing) 
I couldn't let you go without giving you a hard time first.

DOCTOR: 
(smiling) 
Well, it seems like Johnsy is going to make a full recovery. I'll come back to check on you later.

V.O. (Doctor) The doctor's smile fades as he walks away, his mind already moving on to the next patient. He can't help but feel a twinge of guilt for not spending more time with Johnsy. But then again, she's in good hands with Sue. She's a fighter, and I have no doubt she'll pull through.

NARRATOR: 
The doctor left the room, leaving Johnsy, Sue, and Behrman alone.

SUE: 
(excitedly) 
We should celebrate! I'll bring in some of your favorite magazines and we can start planning your next painting.

V.O. (Sue) Wow, I can't believe Johnsy is finally starting to feel better. I'm so excited to see her smiling again. I know how much she loves her magazines and painting. Maybe this will be the start of a new, brighter chapter for her. I won't give up on her, I'll keep bringing her joy and hope.

JOHNSY: 
(happily) 
I can't wait.

BEHRMAN: 
(grinning) 
And I'll bring over some of my famous hot toddies to celebrate.

V.O. (Behrman) BEHRMAN: (grinning) My famous hot toddies always do the trick. I'll make sure to bring extra for Sue. She's been a rock for Johnsy, but I know she's struggling too. I just hope Johnsy's spirits will be lifted. She's been through so much.

NARRATOR: 
The three friends laughed and talked well into the night, grateful for the second chance that Johnsy had been given. And as Johnsy picked up her pen and began to sketch once again, she knew that she would never give up on her dreams again.

"Every Sunday he met in this very spot Monsieur Sauvage, a stout, jolly, little man, a draper in the Rue Notre Dame de Lorette, and also an ardent fisherman. They often spent half the day side by side, rod in hand and feet dangling over the water, and a warm friendship had sprung up between the two.  Some days they did not speak; at other times they chatted; but they understood each other perfectly without the aid of words, having similar tastes and feelings.  In the spring, about ten o'clock in the morning, when the early sun caused a light mist to float on the water and gently warmed the backs of the two enthusiastic anglers, Morissot would occasionally remark to his neighbor:  ""My, but it's pleasant here.""  To which the other would reply:  ""I can't imagine anything better!""  And these few words sufficed to make them understand and appreciate each other.  In the autumn, toward the close of day, when the setting sun shed a blood-red glow over the western sky, and the reflection of the crimson clouds tinged the whole river with red, brought a glow to the faces of the two friends, and gilded the trees, whose leaves were already turning at the first chill touch of winter, Monsieur Sauvage would sometimes smile at Morissot, and say:  ""What a glorious spectacle!""  And Morissot would answer, without taking his eyes from his float:  ""This is much better than the boulevard, isn't it?""  As soon as they recognized each other they shook hands cordially, affected at the thought of meeting under such changed circumstances.  Monsieur Sauvage, with a sigh, murmured:  ""These are sad times!""  Morissot shook his head mournfully.  ""And such weather! This is the first fine day of the year.""  The sky was, in fact, of a bright, cloudless blue.  They walked along, side by side, reflective and sad.  ""And to think of the fishing!"" said Morissot. ""What good times we used to have!""  ""When shall we be able to fish again?"" asked Monsieur Sauvage.  They entered a small cafe and took an absinthe together, then resumed their walk along the pavement.  Morissot stopped suddenly.  ""Shall we have another absinthe?"" he said.  ""If you like,"" agreed Monsieur Sauvage.  And they entered another wine shop.  They were quite unsteady when they came out, owing to the effect of the alcohol on their empty stomachs. ",drama,serious,"Monsieur Sauvage, Morissot, Colonel Dumoulin","NARRATOR: 
The sun was just rising, casting a soft golden light over the serene riverbank.

MONSIEUR SAUVAGE:

These are tough times.

MORISSOT: 
(nods) 
Yes, but we still have each other and our love for fishing.

NARRATOR: 
The two friends sat side by side, their fishing rods in hand. Their feet dangled over the water as they basked in the warmth of the early morning sun. Despite the silence, their understanding of each other's thoughts and feelings was palpable.

COLONEL DUMOULIN: 
(sternly)

As Monsieur Sauvage gazes at the breathtaking view before him, he can't help but feel grateful for his friend's companionship. But deep down, he knows that their peaceful fishing days may soon come to an end. Yet, in this moment, he chooses to savor the company of his dear friend.

NARRATOR: 
As the day progressed, the autumn chill crept in, but the beauty of the sunset over the river and the crimson clouds reflected in the water brought a sense of awe to the three men.

MORISSOT:

To friendship and simpler times.

V.O. (Morissot) As I raise my glass, memories of simpler times flood my mind. The warmth of the sun and the beauty of the riverbank, a stark contrast to the weight of the world. Our friendship, a source of comfort in these uncertain times. To friendship and simpler times, may they return soon.

NARRATOR: 
They shared a drink, but their minds were heavy with the weight of the world. The memories of their carefree fishing days were bittersweet, as they wondered when they would be able to enjoy such simple pleasures again.

COLONEL DUMOULIN: 
(raises his glass) 
To better days ahead.

The alcohol numbed their senses, but their friendship remained strong, a beacon of hope in these uncertain times.

MONSIEUR SAUVAGE:

Remember when we used to compete for the biggest catch?

MORISSOT: 
(laughs) 
Yes, but now we compete for who can tell the best fishing stories.

V.O. (Morissot) Morissot laughs, but deep down he feels a twinge of sadness. As they sit in silence, he can't help but reminisce about the days when they would compete for the biggest catch. Now, they compete for who can tell the best stories, a reminder of the simpler times. He takes a sip of his drink, trying to numb the pain of reality. But as he looks at his friend, he knows their bond will never fade, even in these uncertain times.

The three men laughed and reminisced about their fishing escapades. Despite the struggles and challenges, they found comfort in each other's company.

"There is a great deal to recommend a plains journey at first. Later, there is nothing at all to recommend it. It has the same monotony as a voyage at sea, only there is less living room, and, instead of being carried, you must progress to a great extent by your own volition. Also the food is coarse, the water poor, and you cannot bathe. To a plainsman, or a man who has the instinct, these things are as nothing in comparison with the charm of the outdoor life, and the pleasing tingling of adventure. But woman is a creature wedded to comfort. She also has a strange instinctive desire to be entirely alone every once in a while, probably because her experiences, while not less numerous than man's, are mainly psychical, and she needs occasionally time to get ""thought up to date."" So Miss Caldwell began to get very impatient.  The afternoon of the sixth day Alfred, Miss Caldwell, and Allen rode along side by side. Alfred was telling a self-effacing story of adventure, and Miss Caldwell was listening carelessly because she had nothing else to do. Allen chaffed lazily when the fancy took him.  ""I happened to have a limb broken at the time,"" Alfred was observing, parenthetically, in his soft tones, ""and so----""  ""What kind of a limb?"" asked the young Easterner, with direct brutality. He glanced with a half-humourous aside at the girl, to whom the little man had been mainly addressing himself.  Alfred hesitated, blushed, lost the thread of his tale, and finally in great confusion reined back his horse by the harsh Spanish bit. He fell to the rear of the little wagon-train, where he hung his head, and went hot and cold by turns in thinking of such an indiscretion before a lady.  The young Easterner spurred up on the right of the girl's mount.  ""He's the queerest little fellow I ever saw!"" he observed, with a laugh. ""Sorry to spoil his story. Was it a good one?""  ""It might have been if you hadn't spoiled it,"" answered the girl, flicking her horse's ears mischievously. The animal danced. ""What did you do it for?""  ""Oh, just to see him squirm. He'll think about that all the rest of the afternoon, and will hardly dare look you in the face next time you meet.""  ""I know. Isn't he funny? The other morning he came around the corner of the wagon and caught me with my hair down. I wish you could have seen him!""  She laughed gayly at the memory.  ",drama,serious,"Alfred, Miss Caldwell, Allen","NARRATOR: 
The sun beats down mercilessly on the travelers as they ride through the vast, flat plains. The wind howls, carrying dust and grit that sting the skin and fill the mouth. The horses' hooves kick up clouds of dirt, the smell of which is almost suffocating. The heat is relentless, making every breath a struggle. Miss Caldwell's face is red and sweaty, her hair plastered to her forehead. She longs for a cool breeze to provide some relief. The journey is monotonous and the discomfort is almost unbearable. The only solace is the occasional conversation, but even that is fleeting.

ALFRED: 
(struggling against the wind) 
This is quite a journey, isn't it?

MISS CALDWELL: 
(nodding) 
Indeed, Alfred. The plains may be beautiful, but they can also be harsh.

ALLEN: 
(laughing) 
I think you're both just being overly dramatic. It's not so bad.

V.O. (Allen) ```
Ugh, these two are so dramatic. Can't believe they're complaining about this heat. It's just a bit of sun and dust, nothing I can't handle. They need to toughen up. I'm actually enjoying this ride, it's a nice break from all the talking.

ALFRED: 
(smiling) 
Perhaps for you, Allen. But Miss Caldwell and I have been on many journeys like this. We know the toll it can take.

MISS CALDWELL: 
(teasing) 
Oh, don't listen to him. He's just enjoying the chance to show off his survival skills.

ALLEN: 
(mock bow) 
Why thank you, Miss Caldwell. I do pride myself on my survival skills.

ALFRED: 
(chuckling) 
I must admit, I'm impressed by your ability to adapt to life on the plains so quickly.

V.O. (Alfred) ```
Impressive. But of course, I wouldn't expect anything less from Miss Caldwell. She's always been a quick learner. I'm grateful for her company, even though this journey is brutal. I hope we reach our destination soon. I can't take much more of this heat.

MISS CALDWELL: 
(smiling) 
He's a natural. But enough about Allen. I want to hear more of your stories, Alfred.

V.O. (Miss Caldwell) Miss Caldwell smiled as she listened to Alfred's stories. The journey was unbearable, but hearing his voice made it bearable. She wished for a cool breeze, but for now, his words were enough. He was a natural storyteller, and she could listen to him all day.

ALFRED: 
(blushing) 
Oh, I don't have any stories worth sharing.

MISS CALDWELL: 
(playfully) 
Nonsense. You always have the most fascinating tales to tell.

ALLEN:

I'm curious, Alfred. What happened with your broken limb?

ALFRED: 
(caught off guard) 
Well, you see, I was on a hunting trip and--

ALLEN: 
(curiously) 
What kind of hunting trip?

ALFRED: 
(embarrassed) 
Well, it wasn't exactly a hunting trip. It was more of a...romantic excursion.

V.O. (Alfred) Oh, why did I have to mention the romantic excursion? I can feel Miss Caldwell's embarrassment radiating off of her. This journey is miserable and I can't even make small talk to distract us. I hope she doesn't think I'm trying to make a move on her.

MISS CALDWELL: 
(teasing) 
Romantic? I never knew you had it in you, Alfred.

ALLEN:

I think we're all learning new things about each other on this journey.

(trying to change the subject) 
Shall we continue on our way? We still have a long journey ahead of us.

MISS CALDWELL: 
(nodding) 
Yes, let's. But I do hope we can stop for a break soon. My horse could use a rest.

ALLEN: 
(smiling) 
And I could use a break from all this dust.

V.O. (Allen) ```ALLEN```'s inner monologue:

God, this heat is unbearable. And the dust, it's everywhere. I can't wait to get out of this sun and take a break. Maybe I can find some shade and catch my breath. Miss Caldwell looks miserable. I wish I could help her. Just a little bit further, then we can rest.

ALFRED: 
(laughing) 
I'll see what I can do. But remember, the plains may be tough, but they're also full of surprises.

V.O. (Alfred) *I can't believe she's laughing at a time like this. The heat is unbearable, the journey feels endless. But she's right, there's always something unexpected. Maybe we'll find a hidden oasis, or stumble upon a friendly village. Anything to break this monotony.*

They were mentioned, and proved to be the best men and women of Thord's relations in the parish.  ""Is there anything else?"" inquired the priest, and looked up.  The peasant hesitated a little.  ""I should like very much to have him baptized by himself,"" said he, finally.  ""That is to say on a week-day?""  ""Next Saturday, at twelve o'clock noon.""  ""Is there anything else?"" inquired the priest.  ""There is nothing else;"" and the peasant twirled his cap, as though he were about to go.  Then the priest rose. ""There is yet this, however,"" said he, and walking toward Thord, he took him by the hand and looked gravely into his eyes: ""God grant that the child may become a blessing to you!""  One day sixteen years later, Thord stood once more in the priest's study.  ""Really, you carry your age astonishingly well, Thord,"" said the priest; for he saw no change whatever in the man.  ""That is because I have no troubles,"" replied Thord.  To this the priest said nothing, but after a while he asked: ""What is your pleasure this evening?""  ""I have come this evening about that son of mine who is to be confirmed to-morrow.""  ""He is a bright boy.""  ""I did not wish to pay the priest until I heard what number the boy would have when he takes his place in church to-morrow.""  ""He will stand number one.'

The priest looked up and recognized him.  ""You come well attended this evening, Thord,""  ""I am here to request that the banns may be published for my son; he is about to marry Karen Storliden, daughter of Gudmund, who stands here beside me.""  ""Why, that is the richest girl in the parish.""  ""So they say,"" replied the peasant, stroking back his hair with one hand.

(walking towards Thord) 
Wait, there is one more thing. (takes Thord's hand) May God grant that your child may become a blessing to you.

NARRATOR: 
Sixteen years later, Thord returns to the priest's study. He has not aged a day, his success and contentment in life reflected in his ageless appearance.

THORD OVERAAS: 
(smiling) 
Good evening, Father. You carry your age astonishingly well.

PRIEST: 
(smiling back) 
Thank you, Thord. What brings you here this evening?

THORD OVERAAS: 
(proudly) 
I have come about my son. He will be confirmed tomorrow.

V.O. (Thord Overaas) Proudly, Thord Overaas stands before the priest, his heart filled with pride for his son's confirmation. Sixteen years ago, he asked for the baptism to be done on a week-day, and now, his son will be the first to be confirmed in church. Eight more years and his son will marry the richest girl in the parish. Time has passed, but Thord's wealth and influence remain unchanged.

PRIEST: 
(nods) 
He is a bright young man.

V.O. (Priest) ```
As Thord pays me for his son's confirmation, I can't help but feel a twinge of sadness. Time has passed so quickly, and yet I am still here, unchanged. But Finn is a good man, and I am proud to have played a part in his journey.

THORD OVERAAS: 
(smiling) 
Yes, he is. I did not wish to pay the priest until I heard what number he would have when he takes his place in church.

PRIEST: 
(nods) 
He will stand number one.

V.O. (Priest) He will stand number one. A child born into wealth and influence, blessed by God and favored by man. My hand will guide him through life, as it has guided his father. The generations continue, my role unchanged. But do they see the true blessings I have bestowed?

THORD OVERAAS: 
(grinning) 
Just as I expected. (hands the priest ten dollars) Here is your payment.

PRIEST: 
(taking the money) 
Thank you, Thord. Is there anything else I can do for you?

THORD OVERAAS: 
(shakes his head) 
No, that is all. Thank you, Father.

NARRATOR: 
Eight years later, Thord returns once again to the priest's study. This time, he is accompanied by a group of men, and at the head of the group is his son, Finn.

THORD OVERAAS: 
(proudly) 
Father, I have come to request that the banns may be published for my son's marriage.

V.O. (Thord Overaas) As Thord stands in the priest's study, his heart swells with pride at the thought of his son's marriage. He has worked hard to secure this union, and he knows it will bring honor and prosperity to his family. But a small voice in his mind wonders if he has truly done enough to ensure his son's happiness.

PRIEST: 
(smiling) 
Of course, Thord. And who is the lucky girl?

THORD OVERAAS: 
(grinning) 
Karen Storliden, daughter of Gudmund. (gestures to a man standing beside him)

PRIEST: 
(surprised) 
Why, that is the richest girl in the parish.

V.O. (Priest) Oh, that's Thord Overaas. He's always been such a devout and generous man. I never would have guessed that his son would end up marrying the richest girl in the parish. But I suppose it's a sign of God's favor. He truly is a blessed child.

THORD OVERAAS: 
(nods) 
Yes, she is. And I am proud to call her my daughter-in-law.

PRIEST: 
(entering the names in his book) 
Congratulations, Thord. And to you, Finn. May God bless your union.

V.O. (Priest) ""Congratulations, Thord. And to you, Finn. May God bless your union."" the priest spoke, entering the names in his book. Thord, a wealthy and influential man, had always been a devout follower. I hope Finn will be the same. My duty is to guide him in the right path.

FINN: 
(smiling) 
Thank you, Father.

NARRATOR: 
The men sign their names, and Thord and Finn leave the priest's study, proud and content with their choices and blessings in life.

"The train rolled on, still passing through hamlets occupied by the victorious army. German soldiers could be seen along the roads, on the edges of fields, standing in front of gates or chatting outside cafes. They covered the soil like African locusts.  The officer said, with a wave of his hand:  ""If I had been in command, I'd have taken Paris, burned everything, killed everybody. No more France!""  The Englishman, through politeness, replied simply:  ""Ah! yes.""  He went on:  ""In twenty years all Europe, all of it, will belong to us. Prussia is more than a match for all of them.""  The Englishmen, getting uneasy, no longer replied. Their faces, which had become impassive, seemed made of wax behind their long whiskers. Then the Prussian officer began to laugh. And still, lolling back, he began to sneer. He sneered at the downfall of France, insulted the prostrate enemy; he sneered at Austria, which had been recently conquered; he sneered at the valiant but fruitless defence of the departments; he sneered at the Garde Mobile and at the useless artillery. He announced that Bismarck was going to build a city of iron with the captured cannon. And suddenly he placed his boots against the thigh of M. Dubuis, who turned away his eyes, reddening to the roots of his hair.  The Englishmen seemed to have become indifferent to all that was going on, as if they were suddenly shut up in their own island, far from the din of the world.  The officer took out his pipe, and looking fixedly at the Frenchman, said:  ""You haven't any tobacco--have you?""  M. Dubuis replied:  ""No, monsieur.""  The German resumed:  ""You might go and buy some for me when the train stops.""  And he began laughing afresh as he added:  ""I'll give you the price of a drink.""  The train whistled, and slackened its pace. They passed a station that had been burned down; and then they stopped altogether.  The German opened the carriage door, and, catching M. Dubuis by the arm, said:  ""Go and do what I told you--quick, quick!""  A Prussian detachment occupied the station. Other soldiers were standing behind wooden gratings, looking on. The engine was getting up steam before starting off again. Then M. Dubuis hurriedly jumped on the platform, and, in spite of the warnings of the station master, dashed into the adjoining compartment.

"One glance over the crumbling wall at the edge was generally sufficient for a visitor of even the strongest nerves. There was a sheer drop of more than a mile straight down, and at the distant bottom were jagged rocks and stunted trees that looked, in the blue haze, like shrubbery.  ""This is the spot,"" said the man to himself, ""and to-morrow morning is the time.""  John Bodman had planned his crime as grimly and relentlessly, and as coolly, as ever he had concocted a deal on the Stock Exchange. There was no thought in his mind of mercy for his unconscious victim. His hatred had carried him far.  The next morning after breakfast, he said to his wife: ""I intend to take a walk in the mountains. Do you wish to come with me?""  ""Yes,"" she answered briefly.  ""Very well, then,"" he said; ""I shall be ready at nine o'clock.""  ""I shall be ready at nine o'clock,"" she repeated after him.  At that hour they left the hotel together, to which he was shortly to return alone. They spoke no word to each other on their way to the Hanging Outlook. The path was practically level, skirting the mountains, for the Hanging Outlook was not much higher above the sea than the hotel.  John Bodman had formed no fixed plan for his procedure when the place was reached. He resolved to be guided by circumstances. Now and then a strange fear arose in his mind that she might cling to him and possibly drag him over the precipice with her. He found himself wondering whether she had any premonition of her fate, and one of his reasons for not speaking was the fear that a tremor in his voice might possibly arouse her suspicions. He resolved that his action should be sharp and sudden, that she might have no chance either to help herself or to drag him with her. Of her screams in that desolate region he had no fear. No one could reach the spot except from the hotel, and no one that morning had left the house, even for an expedition to the glacier--one of the easiest and most popular trips from the place.  Curiously enough, when they came within sight of the Hanging Outlook, Mrs. Bodman stopped and shuddered. Bodman looked at her through the narrow slits of his veiled eyes, and wondered again if she had any suspicion. No one can tell, when two people walk closely together, what unconscious communication one mind may have with another.  ",drama,suspenseful,"John Bodman, Mrs. Bodman","NARRATOR:

"Vivienne was about twenty-one. She was of the purest Saxon type. Her hair was a ruddy golden, each filament of the neatly gathered mass shining with its own lustre and delicate graduation of colour. In perfect harmony were her ivory-clear complexion and deep sea-blue eyes that looked upon the world with the ingenuous calmness of a mermaid or the pixie of an undiscovered mountain stream. Her frame was strong and yet possessed the grace of absolute naturalness. And yet with all her Northern clearness and frankness of line and colouring, there seemed to be something of the tropics in her -- something of languor in the droop of her pose, of love of ease in her ingenious complacency of satisfaction and comfort in the mere act of breathing -- something that seemed to claim for her a right as a perfect work of nature to exist and be admired equally with a rare flower or some beautiful, milk-white dove among its sober-hued companions.  She was dressed in a white waist and dark skirt -- that discreet masquerade of goose-girl and duchess.  ""Vivienne,"" said Hartley, looking at her pleadingly, ""you did not answer my last letter. It was only by nearly a week's search that I found where you had moved to. Why have you kept me in suspense when you knew how anxiously I was waiting to see you and hear from you?""  The girl looked out the window dreamily.  ""Mr. Hartley,"" she said hesitatingly, ""I hardly know what to say to you. I realize all the advantages of your offer, and sometimes I feel sure that I could be contented with you. But, again, I am doubtful. I was born a city girl, and I am afraid to bind myself to a quiet suburban life.""  ""My dear girl,"" said Hartley, ardently, ""have I not told you that you shall have everything that your heart can desire that is in my power to give you? You shall come to the city for the theatres, for shopping and to visit your friends as often as you care to. You can trust me, can you not?""  ""To the fullest,"" she said, turning her frank eyes upon him with a smile. ""I know you are the kindest of men, and that the girl you get will be a lucky one. I learned all about you when I was at the Montgomerys'.""  ""Ah!"" exclaimed Hartley, with a tender, reminiscent light in his eye; ""I remember well the evening I first saw you at the Montgomerys'. Mrs. Montgomery was sounding your praises to me all the evening. And she hardly did you justice. I shall never forget that supper. Come, Vivienne, promise me. I want you. You'll never regret coming with me. No one else will ever give you as pleasant a home.""  The girl sighed and looked down at her folded hands.

We only knew that we were stopped by high water in front and rear, and that Miggles was our rock of refuge. A ten minutes splashing through a tangled by- road, scarcely wide enough for the stage, and we drew up before a barred and boarded gate in a wide stone wall or fence about eight feet high. Evidently Miggles's, and evidently Miggles did not keep a hotel.  The driver got down and tried the gate. It was securely locked. Miggles! O Miggles!""  No answer.  ""Migg-ells!

The Judge, who had finally got the window down, put his head out and propounded a series of questions, which if answered categorically would have undoubtedly elucidated the whole mystery, but which the driver evaded by replying that ""if we didn't want to sit in the coach all night, we had better rise up and sing out for Miggles.""  So we rose up and called on Miggles in chorus; then separately. And when we had finished, a Hibernian fellow-passenger from the roof called for ""Maygells!"" whereat we all laughed.

"Corley's stride acknowledged the compliment. The swing of his burly body made his friend execute a few light skips from the path to the roadway and back again. Corley was the son of an inspector of police and he had inherited his father's frame and gut. He walked with his hands by his sides, holding himself erect and swaying his head from side to side. His head was large, globular and oily; it sweated in all weathers; and his large round hat, set upon it sideways, looked like a bulb which had grown out of another. He always stared straight before him as if he were on parade and, when he wished to gaze after someone in the street, it was necessary for him to move his body from the hips. At present he was about town. Whenever any job was vacant a friend was always ready to give him the hard word. He was often to be seen walking with policemen in plain clothes, talking earnestly. He knew the inner side of all affairs and was fond of delivering final judgments. He spoke without listening to the speech of his companions. His conversation was mainly about himself what he had said to such a person and what such a person had said to him and what he had said to settle the matter. When he reported these dialogues he aspirated the first letter of his name after the manner of Florentines.  Lenehan offered his friend a cigarette. As the two young men walked on through the crowd Corley occasionally turned to smile at some of the passing girls but Lenehan's gaze was fixed on the large faint moon circled with a double halo. He watched earnestly the passing of the grey web of twilight across its face. At length he said:  ""Well... tell me, Corley, I suppose you'll be able to pull it off all right, eh?""  Corley closed one eye expressively as an answer.  ""Is she game for that?"" asked Lenehan dubiously. ""You can never know women.""  ""She's all right,"" said Corley. ""I know the way to get around her, man. She's a bit gone on me.""  ""You're what I call a gay Lothario,"" said Lenehan. ""And the proper kind of a Lothario, too!""  A shade of mockery relieved the servility of his manner. To save himself he had the habit of leaving his flattery open to the interpretation of raillery. But Corley had not a subtle mind.

His head was large, oily and globular, always sweating in all weather. Lenehan, tall and lanky, walked with a slight swagger, his eyes scanning the streets for any opportunity that came his way.

CORLEY: 
(smiling at passing girls) 
I tell ya, Lenehan, it's all about confidence. You gotta know how to work these women.

LENEHAN: 
(teasing) 
And you, my friend, are quite the expert, aren't ya?

V.O. (Lenehan) Lenehan watches Corley's confident swagger and can't help but feel a bit envious. He wishes he had that same inherited confidence, but he knows he'll have to work harder for it. He's amused by Corley's bravado and can't resist teasing him, even though he knows Corley is probably right about manipulating women. But deep down, Lenehan can't help but wonder if it's really that easy.

CORLEY: 
(confidently) 
I know the way to get around them, man. She's a bit gone on me.

LENEHAN: 
(dubiously) 
Is she game for that? You can never know women.

CORLEY: 
(rolling his eyes) 
Trust me, she's all right. I've got it all under control.

V.O. (Corley) Ugh, Lenehan can be such a buzzkill. But I can't let him see my frustration. I've got to stay in control, especially with this woman. She's different. But I know what I'm doing. I've done this before. I'll get what I want. I always do.

LENEHAN: 
(smiling) 
You're what I call a gay Lothario.

CORLEY: 
(smiling) 
And the proper kind of a Lothario, too!

V.O. (Corley) ""Women are so easy to manipulate, it's almost laughable. I've inherited my father's charm and confidence, and it serves me well. This plan will be a piece of cake. I'll have her wrapped around my finger in no time. Lenehan's teasing doesn't bother me, he just doesn't understand my power over women.""

NARRATOR: 
Corley and Lenehan continued to walk, their conversation turning to the details of their plan. As they passed a group of policemen, Corley greeted them with a nod, his confidence never wavering.

CORLEY: 
(nodding at the policemen) 
See, Lenehan? It's all about who you know. These guys are my ticket to success.

LENEHAN: 
(jokingly) 
And here I thought it was your charming personality.

CORLEY: 
(smiling) 
Hey, a little charm never hurt anyone.

NARRATOR: 
The two men continued on their way, their conversation growing more serious as they discussed the final details of their plan.

CORLEY: 
(finalizing their plan) 
So, it's all set. We'll meet here tomorrow night, and everything will go off without a hitch.

V.O. (Corley) ""Ha, Lenehan always doubts me. But I know this plan will work. Women are simple creatures, easily swayed by charm and flattery. And with my confidence and charm, she won't stand a chance. I can't wait to see her tomorrow night, under my control. This will be a piece of cake.""

LENEHAN: 
(nervously) 
I hope so. This is a big risk we're taking.

CORLEY: 
(confidently) 
Trust me, Lenehan. It's all going to work out. Now, let's grab a drink and celebrate our success.

V.O. (Corley) I've got Lenehan wrapped around my finger. He may not believe in my methods, but I know how to charm a woman. My father taught me well. This plan will work, I can feel it. Time to celebrate our victory and show these ladies what I'm made of.

NARRATOR: 
As Corley and Lenehan made their way to the nearest pub, the city continued to bustle around them, the sounds of traffic and chatter filling the air. But for Corley, all that mattered was the success of his plan. He knew that with his charm and confidence, he could accomplish anything. And Lenehan, with his quick wit and smooth talking, was the perfect partner in crime. Together, they were unstoppable.

"He sighed, and, striking a match, applied it to his pipe and sat smoking thoughtfully.  ""The young fellow is pretending that his arm is at the back of her by accident,"" he continued; ""and she's pretending not to know that it's there. When he's allowed to put it round 'er waist whenever he wishes, he won't want to do it. She's artful enough to know that, and that's why they are all so stand-offish until the thing is settled. She'll move forward 'arf an inch presently, and 'arf a minute arterwards she'll lean back agin without thinking. She's a nice-looking gal, and what she can see in a tailor's dummy like that, I can't think.""  He leaned back on his box and, folding his arms, emitted a cloud of smoke.  ""Human natur's a funny thing. I've seen a lot of it in my time, and if I was to 'ave my life all over agin I expect I should be just as silly as them two in the skiff.

""That gal in the boat reminds me o' one I used to know a few years ago. Just the same innercent baby look--a look as if butter wouldn't melt in 'er mouth--and a artful disposition that made me sorry for 'er sects.  ""She used to come up to this wharf once a week in a schooner called the Belle. Her father, Cap'n Butt, was a widow-man, and 'e used to bring her with 'im, partly for company and partly because 'e could keep 'is eye on her.

""I'd often took a bit o' notice o' the gal; just giving 'er a kind smile now and then as she sat on deck, and sometimes--when 'er father wasn't looking--she'd smile back. Once, when 'e was down below, she laughed right out. She was afraid of 'im, and by and by I noticed that she daren't even get off the ship and walk up and down the wharf without asking 'im. When she went out 'e was with 'er, and, from one or two nasty little snacks I 'appened to overhear when the skipper thought I was too far away, I began to see that something was up.  ""It all came out one evening, and it only came out because the skipper wanted my help. I was standing leaning on my broom to get my breath back arter a bit o' sweeping, when he came up to me, and I knew at once, by the nice way 'e spoke, that he wanted me to do something for 'im.

V.O. (Bill) As I watch the young couple in the skiff, I can't help but smile. Ah, young love. Reminds me of a similar situation from my past. The memory of her cunning nature still lingers, but I push it aside as the captain approaches. The sea, the waves, and human nature. All strange, yet somehow beautiful.

Of course, what do you need?

I think he knows, deep down. He just doesn't want to admit it.

Maybe you're right, Bill. Maybe I can.

V.O. (Joe) What a strange coincidence, Bill, that this couple's situation reminds me of my own past. Maybe I can help them avoid the same mistakes I made. And maybe the sea air and the gentle waves will clear my mind and bring some peace to my troubled thoughts.

NARRATOR: 
As the sun sets and the evening light fades, the three men stand in silence, watching the young couple in the boat. Each lost in their own thoughts, wondering what the future holds for Winnie and her father. And for themselves. For human nature is a funny thing, and love even funnier. But in the end, it's all just a part of life's grand adventure.

"Men climbed the trunks, everywhere shaking the laden branches and hitting them with long bamboo poles to knock the fruit off, while women and children, squatting on their haunches, spent laborious hours filling baskets underneath, then loading mules and donkeys with their daily ""catch."" But an olive to eat was unobtainable. He had never cared for olives, but now he craved with all his soul to feel his teeth in one.  ""Ach! But it is the Spanish olive that you eat,"" explained the head waiter, a German ""from Basel."" ""These are for oil only."" After which he disliked the olive more than ever--until that night when he saw the first eatable specimen rolling across the shiny parquet floor, propelled towards him by the careless hand of a pretty girl, who then looked up into his eyes and smiled.  He was convinced that Eve, similarly, had rolled the apple towards Adam across the emerald sward of the first garden in the world.  He slept usually like the dead. It must have been something very real that made him open his eyes and sit up in bed alertly. There was a noise against his door. He listened. The room was still quite dark. It was early morning. The noise was not repeated.  ""Who's there?"" he asked in a sleepy whisper. ""What is it?""  The noise came again. Some one was scratching on the door. No, it was somebody tapping.  ""What do you want?"" he demanded in a louder voice. ""Come in,"" he added, wondering sleepily whether he was presentable. Either the hotel was on fire or the porter was waking the wrong person for some sunrise expedition.  Nothing happened. Wide awake now, he turned the switch on, but no light flooded the room. The electricians, he remembered with a curse, were out on strike. He fumbled for the matches, and as he did so a voice in the corridor became distinctly audible. It was just outside his door.  ""Aren't you ready?"" he heard. ""You sleep for ever.""  And the voice, although never having heard it before, he could not have recognised it, belonged, he knew suddenly, to the girl who had let the olive fall. In an instant he was out of bed. He lit a candle.  ""I'm coming,"" he called softly, as he slipped rapidly into some clothes. ""I'm sorry I've kept you. I shan't be a minute.""  ""Be quick then!"" he heard, while the candle flame slowly grew, and he found his garments. Less than three minutes later he opened the door and, candle in hand, peered into the dark passage.  ""Blow it out!"" came a peremptory whisper. He obeyed, but not quick enough. A pair of red lips emerged from the shadows. There was a puff, and the candle was extinguished.

V.O. (The Head Waiter) ""Ah, the elusive olive girl. She's always been a mystery to us all. Smirking, I watch her pluck olives with ease, her laughter ringing through the grove.

Hey, it's hard work! We need our fuel.

(smiling) 
And what a lovely fuel it is. But remember, these olives are for oil only.

(disappointed) 
Well, that's a shame. I've always craved for a good olive to eat.

(teasingly) 
I'll keep that in mind. Maybe I'll bring you one someday.

THE PROTAGONIST:

I'll hold you to that.

""I'll hold you to that,"" I said, my heart racing as I leaned in closer. The sun's warm embrace couldn't compare to the way her smile lit up the grove. I'd do anything to be with her, even if it meant sacrificing my peaceful mornings. She was worth it.

NARRATOR: 
The two shared a playful exchange, their eyes locked in a silent understanding. Little did they know, this was just the beginning of a love story that would rival that of Adam and Eve.

THE PROTAGONIST: 
(excitedly) 
Who's there?

V.O. (The Protagonist) My heart races with anticipation as I call out into the olive grove. Who could it be? My eyes scan the bustling scene, but all I see is her. The one who stole my heart with a single smile. I would do anything to be by her side, even if it means braving the darkness.

THE GIRL: 
(whispering) 
It's me. I've come to take you on an adventure.

V.O. (The Girl) ```
She's the one. The one I've been waiting for. The one who's come to take me away from this mundane life. I can feel the excitement and curiosity bubbling inside me, ready to burst forth into a new adventure. I can't wait to see where she'll take me.

THE PROTAGONIST: 
(amused) 
At this hour? Where are we going?

THE GIRL: 
(mischievously) 
It's a surprise. Now hurry up and get dressed.

V.O. (The Girl) ```
She's up to something, I can tell by the way she's looking at me. But I can't resist her mischievous smile. The sun, the olives, the laughter, they all fade away when she's around. I'll do anything for her, even if it means getting dressed in a hurry.

NARRATOR: 
The protagonist quickly got dressed, his heart racing with anticipation. He opened the door to find the girl standing in the dimly lit hallway, her eyes sparkling in the darkness.

THE PROTAGONIST: 
(whispering) 
Lead the way.

THE GIRL: 
(grinning) 
Follow me.

NARRATOR: 
And so, they embarked on their adventure, guided by the light of the moon and the warmth of their growing feelings for each other. As they walked through the olive grove, the protagonist couldn't help but feel like he was in a dream.

THE PROTAGONIST: 
(whispering) 
This is beautiful.

V.O. (The Protagonist) ```
This is beautiful. The sun, the scent, the laughter, the girl. She's all I see. Her smile, her eyes, they captivate me. I'd do anything for her. I'd even sacrifice the darkness of the early morning just to be with her. She's my everything.

THE GIRL: 
(whispering back) 
Not as beautiful as you.

NARRATOR: 
The two shared a tender moment, their hands intertwined as they walked. And as the night wore on, they found themselves lost in each other's company, their hearts and souls intertwined like the branches of the olive trees above them.

THE PROTAGONIST: 
(whispering) 
I never want this night to end.

V.O. (The Protagonist) ```THE PROTAGONIST```'s heart was racing as he watched her. Her smile, her eyes, everything about her was like a dream. I never want this night to end. I never want to leave her side. She's the light in my darkness, the reason I would do anything for her.

(whispering back) 
It doesn't have to.

""The way he looks at me, it's like I'm the only thing that matters. But why? I'm just a girl in an olive grove, surrounded by hardworking people. Yet he sees something in me, something worth risking everything for. Maybe, just maybe, it doesn't have to make sense. Maybe it's just love.""

And so, they stayed in the olive grove, lost in each other's embrace as the sun rose and a new day began. A day filled with endless possibilities and a love that would last a lifetime.

Sherlock Holmes' keen gaze swept over the occupant of his office, taking in every detail with a practiced eye.

The room was quiet, save for the occasional scratch of Holmes' pen as he made notes. With each passing moment, the tension in the room grew thicker, as Holmes revealed his deductions one by one. The mystery deepened, and the seriousness of the situation became apparent.

I now take this grain of sand—you hold it, Hoo-Hoo."" He dropped the grain of sand into the lad's palm and went on. ""Now that grain of sand stands for the ten fingers of Edwin. I add another grain. That's ten more fingers. And I add another, and another, and another, until I have added as many grains as Edwin has fingers and thumbs. That makes what I call one hundred.

They stand for a thousand fingers. I take a mussel-shell, and it stands for ten pebbles, or one hundred grains of sand, or one thousand fingers...."" And so on, laboriously, and with much reiteration, he strove to build up in their minds a crude conception of numbers.

For still higher sums, he laid the symbols on the log of driftwood; and for symbols he was hard put, being compelled to use the teeth from the skulls for millions, and the crab-shells for billions. It was here that he stopped, for the boys were showing signs of becoming tired. ""There were four million people in San Francisco—four teeth."" The boys' eyes ranged along from the teeth and from hand to hand, down through the pebbles and sand-grains to Edwin's fingers. And back again they ranged along the ascending series in the effort to grasp such inconceivable numbers. ""That was a lot of folks, Granser,"" Edwin at last hazarded. ""Like sand on the beach here, like sand on the beach, each grain of sand a man, or woman, or child. Yes, my boy, all those people lived right here in San Francisco. And at one time or another all those people came out on this very beach—more people than there are grains of sand. More—more—more. And San Francisco was a noble city. And across the bay—where we camped last year, even more people lived, clear from Point Richmond, on the level ground and on the hills, all the way around to San Leandro—one great city of seven million people.—Seven teeth... there, that's it, seven millions.""

Ten fingers? That's not very many.

V.O. (Edwin) Wow, seven million people? That's more than I can even imagine. Granser always teaches us such interesting things. I can't believe how big this city is, and how many people used to live here. I wonder what it was like back then.

Exactly. But as we add more grains, the numbers grow larger and larger.

Yes! And ten pebbles represent a thousand fingers. Imagine that, a thousand fingers!

"We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes. ""You are not very vulnerable from above,"" Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him. ""Nor from below,"" said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. ""Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!"" he remarked, looking up in surprise. ""I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!"" said Holmes severely. ""You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?"" The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket. ""We have at least an hour before us,"" he remarked, ""for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor—as no doubt you have divined—in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present."" ""It is our French gold,"" whispered the director. ""We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it."" ""Your French gold?"" ""Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar.""",mystery,suspenseful," Sherlock Holmes, Mr. Merryweather, Dr. Watson","NARRATOR:

He struggled to keep up, but his legs felt like stone. “Wait,” he begged. “Please . . .” As he climbed, his vision began to blur. There was a thundering in his ears. I must reach her! But when he looked up again, the woman had disappeared. In her place stood an old man with rotting teeth. The man stared down, curling his lips into a lonely grimace. Then he let out a scream of anguish that resounded across the desert. Robert Langdon awoke with a start from his nightmare. The phone beside his bed was ringing. Dazed, he picked up the receiver. “Hello?” “I’m looking for Robert Langdon,” a man’s voice said. Langdon sat up in his empty bed and tried to clear his mind. “This . . . is Robert Langdon.” He squinted at his digital clock. It was 5:18 A.M. “I must see you immediately.” “Who is this?” “My name is Maximilian Kohler. I’m a discrete particle physicist.” “A what?” Langdon could barely focus. “Are you sure you’ve got the right Langdon?” “You’re a professor of religious iconology at Harvard University. You’ve written three books on symbology and—” “Do you know what time it is?” “I apologize. I have something you need to see. I can’t discuss it on the phone.”A knowing groan escaped Langdon’s lips. This had happened before. One of the perils of writing books about religious symbology was the calls from religious zealots who wanted him to confirm their latest sign from God. Last month a stripper from Oklahoma had promised Langdon the best sex of his life if he would fly down and verify the authenticity of a cruciform that had magically appeared on her bed sheets. The Shroud of Tulsa, Langdon had called it. “How did you get my number?” Langdon tried to be polite, despite the hour. “On the Worldwide Web. The site for your book.” Langdon frowned. He was damn sure his book’s site did not include his home phone number. The man was obviously lying. “I need to see you,” the caller insisted. “I’ll pay you well.” Now Langdon was getting mad. “I’m sorry, but I really—” “If you leave immediately, you can be here by—” “I’m not going anywhere!

"Hundreds of miles from CERN, a voice crackled through a walkie-talkie. “Okay, I’m in the hallway.” The technician monitoring the video screens pressed the button on his transmitter. “You’re looking for camera #86. It’s supposed to be at the far end.” There was a long silence on the radio. The waiting technician broke a light sweat. Finally his radio clicked. “The camera isn’t here,” the voice said. “I can see where it was mounted, though. Somebody must have removed it.” The technician exhaled heavily. “Thanks. Hold on a second, will you?” Sighing, he redirected his attention to the bank of video screens in front of him. Huge portions of the complex were open to the public, and wireless cameras had gone missing before, usually stolen by visiting pranksters looking for souvenirs. But as soon as a camera left the facility and was out of range, the signal was lost, and the screen went blank. Perplexed, the technician gazed up at the monitor. A crystal clear image was still coming from camera #86. If the camera was stolen, he wondered, why are we still getting a signal? He knew, of course, there was only one explanation. The camera was still inside the complex, and someone had simply moved it. But who? And why? He studied the monitor a long moment. Finally he picked up his walkietalkie. “Are there any closets in that stairwell? Any cupboards or dark alcoves?” The voice replying sounded confused. “No. Why?” The technician frowned. “Never mind. Thanks for your help.” He turned off his walkie-talkie and pursed his lips. Considering the small size of the video camera and the fact that it was wireless, the technician knew that camera #86 could be transmitting from just about anywhere within the heavily guarded compound—a densely packed collection of thirty-two separate buildings covering a half-mile radius. The only clue was that the camera seemed to have been placed somewhere dark. Of course, that wasn’t much help. The complex contained endless dark locations —maintenance closets, heating ducts, gardening sheds, bedroom wardrobes, even a labyrinth of underground tunnels. Camera #86 could take weeks to locate.

His book was virtually unknown in mainstream literary circles, but it had developed quite a following on-line. Nonetheless, the caller’s claim still made no sense. “That page has no contact information,” Langdon challenged. “I’m certain of it.” “I have people here at the lab very adept at extracting user information from the Web.” Langdon was skeptical. “Sounds like your lab knows a lot about the Web.” “We should,” the man fired back. “We invented it.” Something in the man’s voice told Langdon he was not joking. “I must see you,” the caller insisted. “This is not a matter we can discuss on the phone.

"Phileas Fogg rightly suspected that his departure from London would create a lively sensation at the West End. The news of the bet spread through the Reform Club, and afforded an exciting topic of conversation to its members. From the club it soon got into the papers throughout England. The boasted ""tour of the world"" was talked about, disputed, argued with as much warmth as if the subject were another Alabama claim. Some took sides with Phileas Fogg, but the large majority shook their heads and declared against him; it was absurd, impossible, they declared, that the tour of the world could be made, except theoretically and on paper, in this minimum of time, and with the existing means of travelling. The Times, Standard, Morning Post, and Daily News, and twenty other highly respectable newspapers scouted Mr. Fogg's project as madness; the Daily Telegraph alone hesitatingly supported him. People in general thought him a lunatic, and blamed his Reform Club friends for having accepted a wager which betrayed the mental aberration of its proposer.  Articles no less passionate than logical appeared on the question, for geography is one of the pet subjects of the English; and the columns devoted to Phileas Fogg's venture were eagerly devoured by all classes of readers. At first some rash individuals, principally of the gentler sex, espoused his cause, which became still more popular when the Illustrated London News came out with his portrait, copied from a photograph in the Reform Club. A few readers of the Daily Telegraph even dared to say, ""Why not, after all? Stranger things have come to pass.""  At last a long article appeared, on the 7th of October, in the bulletin of the Royal Geographical Society, which treated the question from every point of view, and demonstrated the utter folly of the enterprise.  Everything, it said, was against the travellers, every obstacle imposed alike by man and by nature. A miraculous agreement of the times of departure and arrival, which was impossible, was absolutely necessary to his success. He might, perhaps, reckon on the arrival of trains at the designated hours, in Europe, where the distances were relatively moderate; but when he calculated upon crossing India in three days, and the United States in seven, could he rely beyond misgiving upon accomplishing his task?

Phileas Fogg's departure from London had caused a lively sensation at the West End and the news of his bet had spread like wildfire, becoming the topic of conversation among the members. The newspapers were filled with passionate and logical articles, both for and against Fogg's seemingly impossible journey around the world. The air was heavy with the scent of ink and paper as people eagerly devoured every word. Some dared to support Fogg, while others dismissed him as a lunatic. But with every obstacle, both man-made and natural, stacked against him, could he truly succeed in his ambitious endeavor?

PHILEAS FOGG: 
(intently) 
I assure you, gentlemen, my plan is foolproof. I have calculated every detail and accounted for every possible delay.

V.O. (Phileas Fogg) I can feel their doubt, their skepticism, but I won't let it shake me. I've meticulously planned every step, every contingency. I won't fail. I can't fail. This journey is my chance to prove them wrong, to show them the power of determination and logic. I will make this bet a reality.

PHILEAS FOGG: 
(smiling confidently) 
Ah, but that is where you are mistaken, my dear friend. With the advancements in modern transportation, I can traverse the globe in a mere eighty days.

MEMBER OF THE ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY: 
(dismissively) 
Ridiculous. Even if you could manage the travel time, the logistics of crossing multiple continents and oceans in such a short period is preposterous.

V.O. (Member Of The Royal Geographical Society) I can't believe the audacity of this man. How dare he think he can conquer the world in such a short time? It's preposterous. And yet, the excitement in this room is undeniable. But I refuse to fall for his delusions. This will surely end in disaster.

BETTING MAN: 
(excitedly) 
But think of the wager, gentlemen! Fogg's journey would be the talk of the town, and we could all stand to make a pretty penny.

V.O. (Betting Man) Excitedly, I can't believe my luck! Fogg's journey will be the talk of the town and I stand to make a fortune. The atmosphere in the club is electric, everyone is talking about the bet. The newspapers are filled with articles, some for, some against. But with all the obstacles, can he really do it? I'll take that chance.

OPPONENT OF PHILEAS FOGG: 
(derisively) 
A wager? This is not a game, it is a serious matter. The mere thought of such a reckless journey is enough to make one's head spin.

ADVOCATE OF PHILEAS FOGG: 
(defiantly) 
On the contrary, it is precisely because of the risks involved that this journey is so thrilling. Fogg is a man of great determination and skill, and I believe he can achieve the impossible.

V.O. (Advocate Of Phileas Fogg) I stand defiantly in the face of doubt and skepticism. Phileas Fogg's journey may seem impossible, but that is precisely why it is so thrilling. His determination and skill will lead him to victory, and I believe in him wholeheartedly. Let the world underestimate him, for they will soon see the impossible become possible.

NARRATOR: 
As the debate raged on, the public's interest in Fogg's bet continued to grow. The newspapers were filled with articles, some in support and others against his journey. But despite the doubts and criticisms, Fogg's resolve remained unwavering.

GENERAL PUBLIC: 
(intrigued) 
Did you hear about this man, Fogg? They say he plans to travel around the world in just eighty days.

SECOND MEMBER OF THE ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY: 
(shaking his head) 
It's madness, pure and simple. No man could possibly accomplish such a feat.

NARRATOR: 
And yet, as Fogg set off on his journey and the days ticked by, the public's interest only intensified. Even the Royal Geographical Society could not deny the progress Fogg was making.

FIRST MEMBER OF THE ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY: 
(amazed) 
He's made it to India in just three days? I must say, I am impressed.

PHILEAS FOGG: 
(proudly) 
Only four days left and I will have completed my journey. I hope my critics are watching.

NARRATOR: 
And with just hours to spare, Fogg arrived back in London, triumphant in his success. The public celebrated his achievement, and even his opponents could not deny the miraculous feat he had accomplished.

OPPONENT OF PHILEAS FOGG: 
(astounded) 
I stand corrected. Fogg, you have truly accomplished the impossible.

V.O. (Opponent Of Phileas Fogg) ""I never thought it was possible, but here I stand, completely amazed. Phileas Fogg, you have truly accomplished the impossible. Your determination and perseverance have proven us all wrong. This is a moment that will be remembered for years to come.""

PHILEAS FOGG: 
(smiling) 
Thank you, my friends. And to think, it all started with a simple bet.

"Presently we saw that the cavern before us opened upon a hazy void. In another moment we had emerged upon a sort of slanting gallery, that projected into a vast circular space, a huge cylindrical pit running vertically up and down. Round this pit the slanting gallery ran without any parapet or protection for a turn and a half, and then plunged high above into the rock again. Somehow it reminded me then one of those spiral turns of the railway through the Saint Gothard. It was all tremendously huge. I can scarcely hope to convey to you the Titanic proportion of all that place, the Titanic effect of it. Our eyes followed up the vast declivity of the pit wall, and overhead and far above we beheld a round opening set with faint stars, and half of the lip about it well nigh blinding with the white light of the sun. At that we cried aloud simultaneously.  ""Come on!"" I said, leading the way.  ""But there?"" said Cavor, and very carefully stepped nearer the edge of the gallery. I followed his example, and craned forward and looked down, but I was dazzled by that gleam of light above, and I could see only a bottomless darkness with spectral patches of crimson and purple floating therein. Yet if I could not see, I could hear. Out of this darkness came a sound, a sound like the angry hum one can hear if one puts one's ear outside a hive of bees, a sound out of that enormous hollow, it may be, four miles beneath our feet...  For a moment I listened, then tightened my grip on my crowbar, and led the way up the gallery.  ""This must be the shaft we looked down upon,"" said Cavor. ""Under that lid.""  ""And below there, is where we saw the lights.""  ""The lights!"" said he. ""Yes--the lights of the world that now we shall never see.""  ""We'll come back,"" I said, for now we had escaped so much I was rashly sanguine that we should recover the sphere.  His answer I did not catch.  ""Eh?"" I asked.  ""It doesn't matter,"" he answered, and we hurried on in silence.  I suppose that slanting lateral way was four or five miles long, allowing for its curvature, and it ascended at a slope that would have made it almost impossibly steep on earth, but which one strode up easily under lunar conditions. We saw only two Selenites during all that portion of our flight, and directly they became aware of us they ran headlong. ",fiction,mysterious,"Narrator, Cavor, Selenites","NARRATOR: 
The cavern before us opened onto a hazy void, the air thick and musty with an eerie stillness. As we emerged onto a slanting gallery, we were met with a vast circular space, a colossal cylindrical pit stretching both above and below. The gallery ran along the edge without any parapet, plunging high into the rock before ascending once again. It was a dizzying spiral, reminiscent of the railway through Saint Gothard.

CAVOR: 
(in awe) 
This is incredible. The scale of it all is beyond anything I could have imagined.

V.O. (Cavor) Incredible. The scale of it all is beyond anything I could have imagined. How could I have ever thought I knew what was out there? This is a whole new world, full of wonders and dangers. We must be careful, yet I can't help but feel exhilarated at the thought of what awaits us.

NARRATOR: 
Our eyes were drawn to a round opening above, set with faint stars and blinding with the white light of the sun. But as we gazed in wonder, a sound emanated from the darkness below - an angry hum like a hive of bees.

[SFX : HUM]

SELENITES: 
(fearful, in their own language) 
Humans! They've found us!

NARRATOR: 
Determined, we pressed on, following the steep ascent of the gallery for miles, encountering only a few Selenites who quickly fled at our approach.

CAVOR: 
(whispers) 
These beings are highly advanced. Imagine what we could learn from them.

NARRATOR: 
We were on a mission to retrieve our stolen sphere, but with each step, the reality of our situation sank in. The lights of the world we knew were now just a distant memory, and the only thing that lay ahead was the unknown.

CAVOR: 
(resolute) 
We must press on. Our quest for knowledge cannot be hindered by fear.

NARRATOR: 
As we continued our ascent, we saw more and more evidence of the Selenites' advanced civilization. Their technology and architecture were unlike anything we had ever seen before.

SELENITES: 
(whispering, in their own language) 
We must protect our secrets at all costs.

NARRATOR: 
But despite their advanced society, they were still bound by the limitations of their environment - living in a world of eternal darkness.

CAVOR: 
(excitedly) 
Look! This must be the shaft we looked down upon. Under that lid.

V.O. (Cavor) ""Wow, this is it. The shaft we saw from above. The lid must be hiding our stolen sphere. But what lies below? The eerie stillness and the hum of angry bees. This is it, our mission to retrieve the sphere. But what awaits us in the unknown?""

NARRATOR: 
We approached the edge of the gallery, peering down into the darkness below.

CAVOR: 
(whispers) 
And below there, is where we saw the lights.

V.O. (Cavor) ```
Whispers. The lights. The cavern. The void. The stillness. The vastness. The spiral. The stars. The sun. The hum. The Selenites. The sphere. The unknown. The fear. The mission. The reality. The memory. The darkness. The only thing left.

NARRATOR: 
The lights of the world that now we shall never see.

CAVOR: 
(disappointed) 
We'll come back. We have to. We can't let this opportunity slip away.

NARRATOR: 
His answer I did not catch.

CAVOR: 
(sighs) 
It doesn't matter. We must focus on the task at hand.

NARRATOR: 
And so, we hurried on in silence. I suppose that slanting lateral way was four or five miles long, allowing for its curvature, and it ascended at a slope that would have made it almost impossibly steep on earth, but which one strode up easily under lunar conditions. We saw only two Selenites during all that portion of our flight, and directly they became aware of us they ran headlong.

NARRATOR: 
The journey was long and treacherous, but we were driven by our thirst for knowledge and determination to succeed. We were two men on a mission, exploring the vast and mysterious lunar landscape, and nothing could stand in our way.

"There was a whirr. The clock shuddered and all at once the door opened. The cuckoo came out, sliding swiftly. He paused and looked around solemnly, scrutinizing her, the room, the furniture.  It was the first time he had seen her, she realized, smiling to herself in pleasure. She stood up, coming toward him shyly. ""Go on,"" she said. ""I'm waiting.""  The cuckoo opened his bill. He whirred and chirped, quickly, rhythmically. Then, after a moment of contemplation, he retired. And the door snapped shut.  She was delighted. She clapped her hands and spun in a little circle. He was marvelous, perfect! And the way he had looked around, studying her, sizing her up. He liked her; she was certain of it. And she, of course, loved him at once, completely. He was just what she had hoped would come out of the little door.  Doris went to the clock. She bent over the little door, her lips close to the wood. ""Do you hear me?"" she whispered. ""I think you're the most wonderful cuckoo in the world."" She paused, embarrassed. ""I hope you'll like it here.""  Then she went downstairs again, slowly, her head high.  Larry and the cuckoo clock really never got along well from the start. Doris said it was because he didn't wind it right, and it didn't like being only half-wound all the time. Larry turned the job of winding over to her; the cuckoo came out every quarter hour and ran the spring down without remorse, and someone had to be ever after it, winding it up again.  Doris did her best, but she forgot a good deal of the time. Then Larry would throw his newspaper down with an elaborate weary motion and stand up. He would go into the dining-room where the clock was mounted on the wall over the fireplace. He would take the clock down and making sure that he had his thumb over the little door, he would wind it up.  ""Why do you put your thumb over the door?"" Doris asked once.  ""You're supposed to.""  She raised an eyebrow. ""Are you sure? I wonder if it isn't that you don't want him to come out while you're standing so close.""  ""Why not?""  ""Maybe you're afraid of him.""  Larry laughed. He put the clock back on the wall and gingerly removed his thumb. When Doris wasn't looking he examined his thumb.",fiction,humorous,"Doris, Larry","NARRATOR: 
Doris stood in front of her quaint cottage, the warm sun beating down on her face. As she approached the door, she heard a whirr. Suddenly, the clock shuddered and the door flew open, revealing a small, swift cuckoo. The bird paused and scanned the room, taking in every detail. It was the first time he had seen Doris, and she couldn't help but smile with delight.

DORIS: 
(smiling) 
Go on.

CUCKOO: 
(whirring and chirping) 
Quickly, rhythmically.

NARRATOR: 
After a moment of contemplation, the cuckoo retired back into the clock, and the door snapped shut.

DORIS: 
(clapping and spinning) 
He's marvelous, perfect! And the way he looked around, studying me, sizing me up. He likes me, I'm certain of it. And I, of course, love him at once, completely. He's just what I hoped would come out of the little door.

V.O. (Doris) Wow, he's even more amazing than I could have imagined. The way he studied me, he must have liked me. And I already love him, he's exactly what I hoped for. I can't believe he came out of that little door. I'm so happy, I could just spin and spin forever.

NARRATOR: 
Doris went to the clock and bent over the little door, her lips close to the wood.

DORIS: 
(whispering) 
Do you hear me? I think you're the most wonderful cuckoo in the world.

V.O. (Doris) ""Do you hear me? I think you're the most wonderful cuckoo in the world,"" Doris whispered, her heart swelling with love for the tiny bird. As she watched him retreat back into the clock, she couldn't help but feel a twinge of sadness. She wished Larry could see the beauty in the cuckoo like she did. But she would continue to cherish their special bond, even if it meant winding the clock herself.

NARRATOR: 
She paused, embarrassed.

DORIS: 
(embarrassed) 
I hope you'll like it here.

V.O. (Doris) I really hope he'll like it here. I've been so excited to show him my little cottage and my dear cuckoo. But I know Larry doesn't understand. He's always so afraid of the cuckoo, but I can feel his playful spirit. I'll just have to remember to wind the clock myself.

NARRATOR: 
Doris then went downstairs again, slowly, her head held high. Larry and the cuckoo clock never got along well from the start. Doris said it was because he didn't wind it right, and it didn't like being only half-wound all the time. Larry turned the job of winding over to her, but the cuckoo still ran the spring down without remorse, and someone had to be ever after it, winding it up again.

LARRY: 
(throwing down newspaper) 
Doris, you forgot to wind the clock again.

DORIS: 
(defensive) 
I did my best, but I got caught up in my painting.

LARRY: 
(sighing) 
I'll take care of it.

V.O. (Larry) ```
""Ugh, not again. I'll have to fix it once more. Why can't Larry just take care of it like he promised? But Doris loves that cuckoo, I can't let her down. I'll just have to wind it myself. Maybe I'll even try to befriend that little bird, it might make Doris happy.""

NARRATOR: 
Larry would go into the dining room where the clock was mounted on the wall over the fireplace. He would take the clock down and make sure his thumb was over the little door before winding it up.

DORIS: 
(curious) 
Why do you put your thumb over the door?

V.O. (Doris) Doris watched as Larry wound the clock, covering the door with his thumb. She wondered why he was always so cautious with the cuckoo, as if he didn't trust it. But she knew better. The bird was full of life and mischief, just like her. And she wouldn't have it any other way.

LARRY: 
(matter-of-fact) 
You're supposed to.

DORIS: 
(raising an eyebrow) 
Are you sure? I wonder if it isn't because you don't want him to come out while you're standing so close.

LARRY: 
(amused) 
Why not?

DORIS: 
(teasing) 
Maybe you're afraid of him.

LARRY: 
(laughing) 
I'm not afraid of a little bird.

NARRATOR: 
He put the clock back on the wall and gingerly removed his thumb. When Doris wasn't looking, he examined his thumb. But Doris could sense the playful spirit of the bird and loved him all the more for it.

DORIS: 
(whispering) 
I know you're just trying to protect your new friend.

V.O. (Doris) Doris smiled at the little cuckoo, feeling a sense of warmth and companionship. She knew Larry didn't understand, but she couldn't help but feel protective of her new friend. She would always make sure the clock was wound properly, no matter how forgetful she was. The cuckoo deserved nothing less.

And so, Larry and the cuckoo clock had formed an unlikely bond, one that brought a little bit of magic into their home.

"""In another moment we were standing face to face, I and this fragile thing out of futurity. He came straight up to me and laughed into my eyes. The absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at once. Then he turned to the two others who were following him and spoke to them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue.  ""There were others coming, and presently a little group of perhaps eight or ten of these exquisite creatures were about me. One of them addressed me. It came into my head, oddly enough, that my voice was too harsh and deep for them. So I shook my head, and, pointing to my ears, shook it again. He came a step forward, hesitated, and then touched my hand. Then I felt other soft little tentacles upon my back and shoulders. They wanted to make sure I was real. There was nothing in this at all alarming. Indeed, there was something in these pretty little people that inspired confidence, a graceful gentleness, a certain childlike ease. And besides, they looked so frail that I could fancy myself flinging the whole dozen of them about like nine-pins. But I made a sudden motion to warn them when I saw their little pink hands feeling at the Time Machine. Happily then, when it was not too late, I thought of a danger I had hitherto forgotten, and reaching over the bars of the machine I unscrewed the little levers that would set it in motion, and put these in my pocket. Then I turned again to see what I could do in the way of communication.  ""And then, looking more nearly into their features, I saw some further peculiarities in their Dresden china type of prettiness. Their hair, which was uniformly curly, came to a sharp end at the neck and cheek; there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the face, and their ears were singularly minute. The mouths were small, with bright red, rather thin lips, and the little chins ran to a point. The eyes were large and mild; and this may seem egotism on my part I fancied even that there was a certain lack of the interest I might have expected in them.  ""As they made no effort to communicate with me, but simply stood round me smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other, I began the conversation. I pointed to the Time Machine and to myself. Then hesitating for a moment how to express time, I pointed to the sun.

You can see the situation. How can we deal with a factor like this? The perfect variable.

Perfect? Prediction should still be possible. A living thing still acts from necessity, the same as inanimate material.

None. Complex life-form. How can we predict the unpredictable? The enemy, a living minefield, has us cornered. But Kramer has an idea, a glimmer of hope. Can we really rely on a miracle? The tension is suffocating. We're grasping at straws, but what other choice do we have?

KRAMER: 
See that? It's a pseudopodium. They're alive, and so far, a weapon we can't beat. No mechanical system can compete with that, simple or intricate. We'll have to scrap the Johnson Control and find something else.

Kramer sighed, exhausted and drained. The pseudopodium was a living weapon, a formidable enemy. Nothing they had could compete. He knew they had to scrap their plans and try something else. But what else could they do? The tension was suffocating. He prayed for a miracle, a way out of this nightmare.

Well, that confirms what I'm saying. How can a ship guided by automatic relays escape a mine that decides to explode? The whole theory of mine penetration is that you must avoid tripping the trigger. But here the trigger is a state of mind in a complicated, developed life-form.

NARRATOR: 
The tension in the room was palpable as they tried to come up with a solution. The only thing left to do was wait and hope for a miracle.

"One day Murlock returned from gunning in a distant part of the forest to find his wife prostrate with fever, and delirious. There was no physician within miles, no neighbor; nor was she in a condition to be left, to summon help. So he set about the task of nursing her back to health, but at the end of the third day she fell into unconsciousness arid so passed away, apparently, with never a gleam of returning reason.  From what we know of a nature like his we may venture to sketch in some of the details of the outline picture drawn by my grandfather. When convinced that she was dead, Murlock had sense enough to remember that the dead must be prepared for burial. In performance of this sacred duty he blundered now and again, did certain things incorrectly, and others which he did correctly were done over and over. His occasional failures to accomplish some simple and ordinary act filled him with astonishment, like that of a drunken man who wonders at the suspension of familiar natural laws. He was surprised, too, that he did not weep--surprised and a little ashamed; surely it is unkind not to weep for the dead. ""Tomorrow,"" he said aloud, ""I shall have to make the coffin arid dig the grave; and then I shall miss her, when she is no longer in sight; but now--she is dead, of course, but it is all right--it must be all right, somehow. Things cannot be so bad as they seem.""  He stood over the body in the fading light, adjusting the hair and putting the finishing touches to the simple toilet, doing all mechanically, with soulless care. And still through his consciousness ran an undersense of conviction that all was right--that he should have her again as before, and everything explained. He had had no experience in grief; his capacity had not been enlarged by use. His heart could not contain it all, nor his imagination rightly conceive it. He did not know he was so hard struck; that knowledge would come later, and never go. Grief is an artist of powers as various as the instruments upon which he plays his dirges for the dead, evoking from some the sharpest, shrillest notes, from others the low, grave chords that throb recurrent like the slow beating of a distant drum. Some natures it startles; some it stupefies. ",horror,suspenseful,"Murlock, Murlock's wife","MURLOCK:

"Every Sunday he met in this very spot Monsieur Sauvage, a stout, jolly, little man, a draper in the Rue Notre Dame de Lorette, and also an ardent fisherman. They often spent half the day side by side, rod in hand and feet dangling over the water, and a warm friendship had sprung up between the two.  Some days they did not speak; at other times they chatted; but they understood each other perfectly without the aid of words, having similar tastes and feelings.  In the spring, about ten o'clock in the morning, when the early sun caused a light mist to float on the water and gently warmed the backs of the two enthusiastic anglers, Morissot would occasionally remark to his neighbor:  ""My, but it's pleasant here.""  To which the other would reply:  ""I can't imagine anything better!""  And these few words sufficed to make them understand and appreciate each other.  In the autumn, toward the close of day, when the setting sun shed a blood-red glow over the western sky, and the reflection of the crimson clouds tinged the whole river with red, brought a glow to the faces of the two friends, and gilded the trees, whose leaves were already turning at the first chill touch of winter, Monsieur Sauvage would sometimes smile at Morissot, and say:  ""What a glorious spectacle!""  And Morissot would answer, without taking his eyes from his float:  ""This is much better than the boulevard, isn't it?""  As soon as they recognized each other they shook hands cordially, affected at the thought of meeting under such changed circumstances.  Monsieur Sauvage, with a sigh, murmured:  ""These are sad times!""  Morissot shook his head mournfully.  ""And such weather! This is the first fine day of the year.""  The sky was, in fact, of a bright, cloudless blue.",fiction,serious,"Morissot, Monsieur Sauvage","NARRATOR: 
As the two men arrived at their usual spot by the river, the cool, crisp air greeted them, a refreshing break from the chaos of the world.

MORISSOT: 
(looking out at the water) 
My, but it's pleasant here.

MONSIEUR SAUVAGE: 
(smiling) 
I can't imagine anything better.

V.O. (Monsieur Sauvage) As Monsieur Sauvage gazes out at the serene river, his heart swells with contentment. The tranquility of this place, the companionship of his dear friend, and the thrill of fishing - it's all he needs. This is his safe haven, his happy place, and he can't imagine anything better.

NARRATOR: 
Their shared love for fishing had brought them together, forming a warm friendship between the two.

MORISSOT: 
(looking at MONSIEUR SAUVAGE) 
I'm glad we met, Monsieur Sauvage. It's nice to have a friend to share this with.

V.O. (Morissot) As I gaze at Monsieur Sauvage, I can't help but feel grateful for his friendship. It's rare to find someone who shares my love for fishing and understands the solace it brings. These Sunday meetings are a much-needed escape from the chaos of the world, a peaceful sanctuary in troubled times.

MONSIEUR SAUVAGE: 
(nodding) 
I feel the same, Morissot. It's a peaceful escape from the troubles of the world.

NARRATOR: 
As they sat side by side, their feet dangling over the water, the gentle warmth of the sun and the light mist floating on the water created a serene atmosphere.

MORISSOT: 
(looking at the sky) 
The changing seasons only add to the beauty of this place. Don't you think, Monsieur Sauvage?

V.O. (Morissot) The cool, crisp air and the gentle warmth of the early sun always remind me of simpler times. When I'm here with Monsieur Sauvage, I can forget about all the chaos in the world. The changing seasons only make this place more beautiful, a true sanctuary for us.

MONSIEUR SAUVAGE: 
(nodding) 
Absolutely. In the spring, the sun gently warms our backs, and in the autumn, the setting sun paints the sky and the river in shades of red.

NARRATOR: 
Their shared appreciation for nature's beauty brought them closer, without the need for words.

MORISSOT: 
(smiling) 
This is much better than the boulevard, isn't it?

V.O. (Morissot) MORISSOT smiled, grateful for the peacefulness of the moment. The river bank was their haven, where they could escape the chaos of the world. With Monsieur Sauvage by his side, he felt understood and content. No boulevard could ever compare to this serene sanctuary. Life was good.

MONSIEUR SAUVAGE: 
(nodding in agreement) 
Indeed, Morissot. This is our sanctuary, our escape from the chaos of the world.

V.O. (Monsieur Sauvage) As Monsieur Sauvage looks out at the serene river and feels the warm sun on his face, he can't help but think how grateful he is for this peaceful escape with his dear friend Morissot. In these chaotic times, this sanctuary is a true blessing.

NARRATOR: 
As the seasons changed and the world became more uncertain, their Sunday meetings remained constant, providing a sense of comfort and normalcy.

Until next Sunday, my friend.

MONSIEUR SAUVAGE:

Until next Sunday, Morissot.

V.O. (Monsieur Sauvage) ""So grateful for this peaceful escape with Morissot every week. The river never fails to amaze me, and neither does his company. The world may be in chaos, but here, in this moment, everything is perfect. Until next Sunday, my dear friend.""

"In the wan light, the faces of the men must have been grey. Their eyes must have glinted in strange ways as they gazed steadily astern. Viewed from a balcony, the whole thing would doubtless have been weirdly picturesque. But the men in the boat had no time to see it, and if they had had leisure there were other things to occupy their minds. The sun swung steadily up the sky, and they knew it was broad day because the color of the sea changed from slate to emerald-green, streaked with amber lights, and the foam was like tumbling snow. The process of the breaking day was unknown to them. They were aware only of this effect upon the color of the waves that rolled toward them.  In disjointed sentences the cook and the correspondent argued as to the difference between a life-saving station and a house of refuge. The cook had said: ""There's a house of refuge just north of the Mosquito Inlet Light, and as soon as they see us, they'll come off in their boat and pick us up.""  ""As soon as who see us?"" said the correspondent.  ""The crew,"" said the cook.  ""Houses of refuge don't have crews,"" said the correspondent. ""As I understand them, they are only places where clothes and grub are stored for the benefit of shipwrecked people. They don't carry crews.""  ""Oh, yes, they do,"" said the cook.  ""No, they don't,"" said the correspondent.  ""Well, we're not there yet, anyhow,"" said the oiler, in the stern.

The wan light cast a grey hue over the faces of the men in the boat, their eyes glinting strangely as they gazed astern. Had they been viewed from a balcony, the scene would have been eerily picturesque. But the men had no time to appreciate it, their minds occupied with the rising sun. As it climbed higher in the sky, the sea transformed from slate to emerald-green, streaked with amber lights. The foam resembled tumbling snow.

THE COOK: 
(eyes scanning the horizon) 
There's a house of refuge just north of the Mosquito Inlet Light. As soon as they see us, they'll come off in their boat and pick us up.

V.O. (The Cook) The cook's mind raced as they approached the house of refuge. Relief washed over him, knowing they would soon be rescued. But as he gazed at the horizon, he couldn't help but wonder if they would have made it if they had gone to the life-saving station instead.

THE CORRESPONDENT: 
(skeptical) 
As soon as who see us?

THE COOK: 
(voice full of conviction) 
The crew.

THE CORRESPONDENT: 
(becoming increasingly frustrated) 
Houses of refuge don't have crews. They're just places where clothes and grub are stored for shipwrecked people. They don't carry crews.

THE COOK: 
(insistent) 
Oh, but they do.

V.O. (The Cook) Oh, but they do. They don't understand the importance of this discussion. The oiler's interruptions only add to my frustration. I can't help but think about the life-saving station. We need to reach it before it's too late. The rising sun may be beautiful, but it's also a reminder of the danger we're in.

THE CORRESPONDENT: 
(disbelieving) 
No, they don't.

V.O. (The Correspondent) No, they don't. I can't believe the cook is still going on about the life-saving station. We need to focus on getting to our destination. The sun is already up and the sea is beautiful, but we can't let our guard down. We have to keep pushing forward.

THE OILER: 
(interrupting) 
(voice calm and steady)

THE COOK: 
(uncertain) 
Well, perhaps it's not a house of refuge that I'm thinking of as being near Mosquito Inlet Light. Maybe it's a life-saving station.

THE OILER: 
(reassuring) 
(still in control of the boat)

NARRATOR: 
The men continued to debate the difference between a life-saving station and a house of refuge as the sun climbed higher in the sky. The cook and the correspondent argued back and forth, their voices growing more heated as the day wore on. The oiler remained calm and focused, his eyes scanning the horizon for any sign of rescue.

THE COOK: 
(emphatic) 
I'm telling you, it's a life-saving station. I know these waters like the back of my hand.

V.O. (The Cook) The cook's heart swelled with pride as he spoke. He knew he was their only hope of survival, and he would guide them safely to shore. The men were too distracted to appreciate the beauty around them, but the cook couldn't help but admire the emerald-green sea. The life-saving station was their salvation, and he would lead them there.

THE CORRESPONDENT: 
(voice full of doubt) 
But how can you be sure?

THE COOK: 
(voice full of conviction) 
Because I've been in this situation before.

THE OILER: 
(voice reassuring) 
And we'll make it out again. We just have to keep our wits about us.

NARRATOR: 
As the day progressed, the men's voices grew hoarse from arguing. But still, they continued on, their determination to reach the life-saving station driving them forward. The sun continued its journey across the sky, the sea changing colors beneath it.

THE COOK: 
(voice full of hope) 
Look, the sea is changing to emerald-green. We must be getting closer.

THE CORRESPONDENT: 
(voice full of wonder) 
It's like a painting.

THE OILER: 
(voice full of determination) 
We'll make it. We have to.

NARRATOR: 
The men fell silent, each lost in their own thoughts as they continued their journey towards the unknown. The colors of the sea continued to change, the sun casting its light upon the waves in ever-changing patterns.

THE COOK: 
(voice full of awe) 
I've never seen anything like it.

V.O. (The Cook) ""I've never seen anything like it,"" the cook thought to himself, his voice full of awe. The beauty of the sea and the rising sun was almost enough to distract him from their dire situation. But he couldn't shake the thought of the life-saving station near Mosquito Inlet Light, hoping it would bring them to safety.

THE CORRESPONDENT: 
(voice full of contemplation) 
It's like witnessing the birth of a new day.

THE OILER: 
(voice full of determination) 
And we'll be there to see it through.

V.O. (The Oiler) The Oiler's mind raced with determination as he rowed, the rising sun a beacon of hope. The others bickered, but he knew they would see it through. The life-saving station was close, he could feel it. The men's glinting eyes and the picturesque scene were just distractions. We'll make it.

NARRATOR: 
And so the men continued on, their voices now full of determination and hope as they sailed towards the life-saving station or house of refuge that awaited them. The sun continued its journey across the sky, casting its light upon the waves and the men in the boat, guiding them towards their destination.

(Whispers) 
Who is he? What happened to him?

NARRATOR: 
Suddenly, a voice breaks the silence.

DON FERGUSSON: 
(Smoking a cigarette) 
You know, I saw him this morning. He was walking down the street, looking lost. I asked him if he needed help, but he just shook his head and kept walking.

JACK POTTER: 
(Joining them) 
I heard he was a drifter. No family or friends in town. Maybe that's why no one noticed him hanging there.

V.O. (Jack Potter) Joining them... Another lost soul, forgotten and alone. I wonder if anyone will mourn for him. Did he choose this fate or was it forced upon him? Will I end up like him, a mere afterthought in this world? The darkness of the night mirrors the emptiness in my heart.

LOYCE: 
But why didn't anyone help him?

DON FERGUSSON: 
(Puffing on his cigarette) 
Maybe they were afraid. Afraid of getting involved.

LOYCE: 
(Angry) 
That's not right. We can't just ignore someone in need.

JACK POTTER: 
(Solemnly) 
He's right. We need to look out for each other.

V.O. (Jack Potter) ```JACK POTTER```'s inner monologue:
Solemnly, I can't shake off this feeling of dread. Loyce's words hit too close to home. We're all alone in this cruel world. We need to stick together, look out for each other. Who knows what could happen to any of us. I won't let anyone else end up like that poor soul.

NARRATOR: 
They stand in silence for a moment, reflecting on the tragedy that has unfolded before them. As the night grows darker, the lamppost continues to loom over the park, casting a haunting shadow over the events that have taken place. For Loyce, Don, and Jack, this will be a night they will never forget. A night that will forever change the way they view their community and the people in it.

"Calixta, at home, felt no uneasiness for their safety. She sat at a side window sewing furiously on a sewing machine. She was greatly occupied and did not notice the approaching storm. But she felt very warm and often stopped to mop her face on which the perspiration gathered in beads. She unfastened her white sacque at the throat. It began to grow dark, and suddenly realizing the situation she got up hurriedly and went about closing windows and doors.  Out on the small front gallery she had hung Bobint's Sunday clothes to dry and she hastened out to gather them before the rain fell. As she stepped outside, Alce Laballire rode in at the gate. She had not seen him very often since her marriage, and never alone. She stood there with Bobint's coat in her hands, and the big rain drops began to fall. Alce rode his horse under the shelter of a side projection where the chickens had huddled and there were plows and a harrow piled up in the corner.  ""May I come and wait on your gallery till the storm is over, Calixta?"" he asked.  Come 'long in, M'sieur Alce.""  His voice and her own startled her as if from a trance, and she seized Bobint's vest. Alce, mounting to the porch, grabbed the trousers and snatched Bibi's braided jacket that was about to be carried away by a sudden gust of wind. He expressed an intention to remain outside, but it was soon apparent that he might as well have been out in the open: the water beat in upon the boards in driving sheets, and he went inside, closing the door after him. It was even necessary to put something beneath the door to keep the water out.  ""My! what a rain! It's good two years sence it rain' like that,"" exclaimed Calixta as she rolled up a piece of bagging and Alce helped her to thrust it beneath the crack.  She was a little fuller of figure than five years before when she married; but she had lost nothing of her vivacity. Her blue eyes still retained their melting quality; and her yellow hair, dishevelled by the wind and rain, kinked more stubbornly than ever about her ears and temples.  The rain beat upon the low, shingled roof with a force and clatter that threatened to break an entrance and deluge them there. They were in the dining room the sitting room the general utility room. Adjoining was her bed room, with Bibi's couch along side her own. The door stood open, and the room with its white, monumental bed, its closed shutters, looked dim and mysterious.  Alce flung himself into a rocker and Calixta nervously began to gather up from the floor the lengths of a cotton sheet which she had been sewing.",romance,Romantic,"Calixta, Bobint, Alce Laballire, Bibi","NARRATOR: 
The gentle pitter-patter of raindrops against the shingled roof filled Calixta's home, as she sat at her sewing machine, completely unaware of the approaching storm. Her focus was solely on her task, her body warm and glistening with perspiration.

(lost in her work) 
This dress needs to be perfect for the church picnic.

V.O. (Calixta) ""Perfect for the church picnic... I can't believe I've been so caught up in my work that I didn't even notice the storm. I hope Bobint's clothes are okay. Oh, there's Alce. It's been so long... Maybe we can catch up while we wait for the storm to pass.""

NARRATOR: 
Suddenly, the room darkened and Calixta realized the situation. Hurriedly, she closed the windows and doors, but not before rushing out to retrieve Bobint's Sunday clothes from the front gallery. As she stepped outside, Alce Laballire rode in, seeking shelter from the downpour.

CALIXTA: 
(surprised) 
Alce? What are you doing here?

ALCE: 
(smiling) 
I was passing by and saw the storm. I thought I'd seek shelter at your home.

V.O. (Alce) ""Wow, the storm is really picking up. I'm glad I decided to stop here, Calixta's home looks cozy. I hope she doesn't mind me intruding. She's so beautiful when she smiles, I can't help but feel drawn to her. Maybe this storm isn't so bad after all.""

NARRATOR: 
With a sense of nostalgia, Calixta welcomed him inside, their conversation filled with playful banter.

CALIXTA: 
(teasing) 
I never thought I'd see you seeking shelter from a storm.

ALCE: 
(laughing) 
I never thought I'd see you in a dress.

The storm raged on, but in each other's company, they found solace and warmth.

CALIXTA:

Bobint is going to be so jealous when he sees you here.

ALCE: 
(smiling) 
Jealous? Why would he be jealous?

CALIXTA: 
(teasing) 
Because he knows you're my first love.

NARRATOR: 
As the rain beat upon the low, shingled roof with a force and clatter, Alce and Calixta's conversation continued, their playful banter turning into heartfelt confessions.

ALCE: 
(softly) 
I always regretted not telling you how I felt before you married Bobint.

CALIXTA: 
(looking into his eyes) 
I never knew...I always wondered.

NARRATOR: 
As they waited out the storm together, Calixta's vivacity and Alce's presence created an unexpected and electric energy within the small house.

CALIXTA: 
(whispering) 
I never knew how much I missed you until now.

V.O. (Calixta) I never knew how much I missed you until now. Your presence brings back memories of our carefree days together. The storm outside may be fierce, but with you by my side, I feel safe and content. I wish this moment could last forever.

ALCE: 
(leaning in) 
I never stopped loving you.

NARRATOR: 
Their lips met in a passionate kiss, the rainstorm only adding to the intensity of the moment.

NARRATOR: 
As the storm finally passed, Alce and Calixta parted ways, knowing that their love for each other would always remain.

(smiling) 
Thank you for seeking shelter with me.

V.O. (Calixta) ""Wow, what a storm. I'm so glad Alce came by. It's been so long since we've seen each other. I'm so happy he's here. It's nice to have company during this downpour. Thank goodness I was here to close the windows and doors. Thank you for seeking shelter with me.""

And as the sun shone once again, Calixta couldn't help but feel grateful for the unexpected storm that brought her back to her first love.

"She did not stop to ask if it were or were not a monstrous joy that held her. A clear and exalted perception enabled her to dismiss the suggestion as trivial. She knew that she would weep again when she saw the kind, tender hands folded in death; the face that had never looked save with love upon her, fixed and gray and dead. But she saw beyond that bitter moment a long procession of years to come that would belong to her absolutely. And she opened and spread her arms out to them in welcome.  There would be no one to live for during those coming years; she would live for herself. There would be no powerful will bending hers in that blind persistence with which men and women believe they have a right to impose a private will upon a fellow-creature. A kind intention or a cruel intention made the act seem no less a crime as she looked upon it in that brief moment of illumination.  And yet she had loved him--sometimes. Often she had not.

It was only yesterday she had thought with a shudder that life might be long.  She arose at length and opened the door to her sister's importunities. There was a feverish triumph in her eyes, and she carried herself unwittingly like a goddess of Victory. She clasped her sister's waist, and together they descended the stairs. Richards stood waiting for them at the bottom.  Someone was opening the front door with a latchkey.

"One evening while Farquhar and his wife were sitting on a rustic bench near the entrance to his grounds, a gray-clad soldier rode up to the gate and asked for a drink of water. Mrs. Farquhar was only too happy to serve him with her own white hands. While she was fetching the water her husband approached the dusty horseman and inquired eagerly for news from the front.  ""The Yanks are repairing the railroads,"" said the man, ""and are getting ready for another advance. They have reached the Owl Creek bridge, put it in order and built a stockade on the north bank. The commandant has issued an order, which is posted everywhere, declaring that any civilian caught interfering with the railroad, its bridges, tunnels or trains will be summarily hanged. I saw the order.""  ""How far is it to the Owl Creek bridge?"" Farquhar asked.  ""About thirty miles.""  ""Is there no force on this side the creek?""  ""Only a picket post half a mile out, on the railroad, and a single sentinel at this end of the bridge.""  ""Suppose a man--a civilian and student of hanging--should elude the picket post and perhaps get the better of the sentinel,"" said Farquhar, smiling, ""what could he accomplish?""  The soldier reflected. ""I was there a month ago,"" he replied. ""I observed that the flood of last winter had lodged a great quantity of driftwood against the wooden pier at this end of the bridge. It is now dry and would burn like tow.""  The lady had now brought the water, which the soldier drank. He thanked her ceremoniously, bowed to her husband and rode away.

The darkness of the night enveloped Farquhar's plantation, with only a few scattered lights from the house providing any illumination. Underneath a star-filled sky, Farquhar and his wife sat on a rustic bench near the entrance to their grounds, enjoying the peace and quiet.

The danger was real, and he knew he had to act fast. The Owl Creek bridge would be the perfect target, and Farquhar couldn't help but smile at the thought of finally making a difference in the war. But as the soldier rode away, the suspense only grew. Farquhar knew the danger was lurking just beyond his plantation's borders, but he couldn't resist the opportunity to take action.

"""Do you think, Colonel, that your brave Coulter would like to put one of his guns in here?"" the general asked.  He was apparently not altogether serious; it certainly did not seem a place where any artillerist, however brave, would like to put a gun. The colonel thought that possibly his division commander meant good-humoredly to intimate that in a recent conversation between them Captain Coulter's courage had been too highly extolled.  ""General,"" he replied warmly, ""Coulter would like to put a gun anywhere within reach of those people,"" with a motion of his hand in the direction of the enemy.  ""It is the only place,"" said the general. He was serious, then.  The place was a depression, a ""notch,"" in the sharp crest of a hill. It was a pass, and through it ran a turnpike, which reaching this highest point in its course by a sinuous ascent through a thin forest made a similar, though less steep, descent toward the enemy. For a mile to the left and a mile to the right, the ridge, though occupied by Federal infantry lying close behind the sharp crest and appearing as if held in place by atmospheric pressure, was inaccessible to artillery. There was no place but the bottom of the notch, and that was barely wide enough for the roadbed. From the Confederate side this point was commanded by two batteries posted on a slightly lower elevation beyond a creek, and a half-mile away. All the guns but one were masked by the trees of an orchard; that one--it seemed a bit of impudence--was on an open lawn directly in front of a rather grandiose building, the planter's dwelling.

He had expected to stay only about three months, at the longest. When a man with as many friends on the outside as Jimmy Valentine had is received in the ""stir"" it is hardly worth while to cut his hair.  ""Now, Valentine,"" said the warden, ""you'll go out in the morning. Brace up, and make a man of yourself. You're not a bad fellow at heart. Stop cracking safes, and live straight.""  ""Me?"" said Jimmy, in surprise. ""Why, I never cracked a safe in my life.""  ""Oh, no,"" laughed the warden. ""Of course not. Let's see, now. How was it you happened to get sent up on that Springfield job? Was it because you wouldn't prove an alibi for fear of compromising somebody in extremely high-toned society?

""Why, warden, I never was in Springfield in my life!""  ""Take him back, Cronin!"" said the warden, ""and fix him up with outgoing clothes. Unlock him at seven in the morning, and let him come to the bull-pen. Better think over my advice, Valentine.""  At a quarter past seven on the next morning Jimmy stood in the warden's outer office. He had on a suit of the villainously fitting, ready-made clothes and a pair of the stiff, squeaky shoes that the state furnishes to its discharged compulsory guests.  The clerk handed him a railroad ticket and the five-dollar bill with which the law expected him to rehabilitate himself into good citizenship and prosperity. The warden gave him a cigar, and shook hands. Valentine, 9762, was chronicled on the books, ""Pardoned by Governor,"" and Mr. James Valentine walked out into the sunshine.  Disregarding the song of the birds, the waving green trees, and the smell of the flowers, Jimmy headed straight for a restaurant. There he tasted the first sweet joys of liberty in the shape of a broiled chicken and a bottle of white wine--followed by a cigar a grade better than the one the warden had given him. From there he proceeded leisurely to the depot. He tossed a quarter into the hat of a blind man sitting by the door, and boarded his train.

(Sighs)

WARDEN: 
(Hands Jimmy the pardon) 
Congratulations, Valentine. You've been pardoned.

JIMMY VALENTINE: 
(Takes the pardon) 
(Tiredly)

WARDEN: 
(Encouraging) 
Brace up, and make a man of yourself. You're not a bad fellow at heart. Stop cracking safes, and live straight.

JIMMY VALENTINE: 
(Surprised) 
Me?

WARDEN: 
(Laughs) 
Of course not. Let's see, now. How was it you happened to get sent up on that Springfield job? Was it because you wouldn't prove an alibi for fear of compromising somebody in extremely high-toned society? Or was it simply a case of a mean old jury that had it in for you? It's always one or the other with you innocent victims.

JIMMY VALENTINE: 
(Still blankly virtuous) 
Why, warden, I never was in Springfield in my life!

WARDEN: 
(Takes out a cigar) 
Here, have a cigar and shake my hand. You're a free man now, Valentine.

V.O. (Warden) I can't believe it. After all these months, I'm finally free. The warden seems so friendly, offering me a cigar and a handshake. But I know better than to trust anyone in this place. I'll take the pardon, but I won't forget what they did to me. Time to start over.

JIMMY VALENTINE: 
(Takes the cigar and shakes the warden's hand) 
Thanks.

V.O. (Jimmy Valentine) Thanks. Finally, freedom. But can I really start over? The warden's pardon is a slap in the face. Ten months for a crime I didn't commit. I'll show them all. A luxurious meal and a train ride won't fix my reputation. But it's a start.

CLERK: 
(Hands Jimmy the ticket and money) 
Good luck, Mr. Valentine. Don't do anything to get yourself back in here.

JIMMY VALENTINE: 
(Smiles) 
Thanks, I won't.

NARRATOR: 
Jimmy walked out into the sunshine, disregarding the song of the birds, the waving green trees, and the smell of the flowers. He headed straight for a restaurant, where he tasted the first sweet joys of liberty in the shape of a broiled chicken and a bottle of white wine--followed by a cigar a grade better than the one the warden had given him.

JIMMY VALENTINE: 
(Tosses a quarter into the hat of the blind man) 
(Smiling)

MIKE DOLAN: 
(Smiling) 
Well, well, if it isn't Jimmy Valentine.

JIMMY VALENTINE: 
(Surprised) 
Mike Dolan, what are you doing here?

MIKE DOLAN: 
(Sits down next to Jimmy) 
Just out for a little ride. How about you?

V.O. (Mike Dolan) ""Just out for a little ride. How about you?"" Mike Dolan asked, trying to hide his anxiety. He couldn't believe that Jimmy was still working in prison, while he was out enjoying the sunshine. It wasn't fair. But maybe, just maybe, Jimmy's luck was about to change.

JIMMY VALENTINE: 
(Shrugs) 
Just trying to get as far away from that prison as possible.

MIKE DOLAN: 
(Grins) 
I know the feeling. But hey, now that we're both free men, we should celebrate.

V.O. (Mike Dolan) MIKE DOLAN: I know the feeling. But hey, now that we're both free men, we should celebrate. (Grins)
Inner monologue:

Wow, Jimmy really lucked out with that pardon. I can't believe he's actually innocent. But I guess that's what happens when you're good at your job. I hope I can make a fresh start like he did. Maybe I'll treat myself to a nice meal too.

JIMMY VALENTINE: 
(Smiles) 
Sounds good to me.

NARRATOR: 
Jimmy and Mike part ways, and Jimmy continues his journey. He arrives at his destination, a small town on the outskirts of the state.

JIMMY VALENTINE: 
(Takes a deep breath) 
(To himself)

V.O. (Jimmy Valentine) (To himself) What a relief to finally breathe fresh air and feel the sun on my face. Ten months behind bars, but now I have a chance at a new life. Do I deserve it? The warden seems to think so, but I can't shake the guilt. Time to leave this all behind.

BEN PRICE: 
(Smiling) 
Well, well, if it isn't Jimmy Valentine.

V.O. (Ben Price) Wow, what are the odds? After all these months, I never expected to see Jimmy Valentine again. But here he is, being escorted out of prison with a pardon. I wonder if he's truly innocent, or if he's just a master at playing the game. Either way, I hope he's learned his lesson.

JIMMY VALENTINE: 
(Surprised) 
Ben Price, what are you doing here?

BEN PRICE: 
(Shrugs) 
Just passing through. I heard you got out of the slammer.

JIMMY VALENTINE: 
(Smiles) 
Yeah, I did. And I'm not planning on going back.

BEN PRICE: 
(Smirks) 
We'll see about that.

NARRATOR: 
Jimmy Valentine, also known as 9762, was chronicled on the books, ""Pardoned by Governor,"" and Mr. James Valentine walked out into the sunshine. He had served ten months of a four-year sentence for a crime he didn't commit. But now, he was a free man, ready to start a new life. And he was determined to stay on the straight and narrow.

"Jerton had not harboured the least intention of extending his thirst for name-labels to his neighbour. After her rather remarkable announcement, however, he was obliged to say something in the way of polite inquiry.  ""Yes,"" answered the lady, ""I suppose it is a case of partial loss of memory. I was in the train coming down here; my ticket told me that I had come from Victoria and was bound for this place. I had a couple of five-pound notes and a sovereign on me, no visiting cards or any other means of identification, and no idea as to who I am. I can only hazily recollect that I have a title; I am Lady Somebody - beyond that my mind is a blank.""  ""Hadn't you any luggage with you?"" asked Jerton.  ""That is what I didn't know. I knew the name of this hotel and made up my mind to come here, and when the hotel porter who meets the trains asked if I had any luggage I had to invent a dressing-bag and dress-basket; I could always pretend that they had gone astray. I gave him the name of Smith, and presently he emerged from a confused pile of luggage and passengers with a dressing- bag and dress-basket labelled Kestrel-Smith. I had to take them; I don't see what else I could have done.""  Jerton said nothing, but he rather wondered what the lawful owner of the baggage would do.  ""Of course it was dreadful arriving at a strange hotel with the name of Kestrel-Smith, but it would have been worse to have arrived without luggage. Anyhow, I hate causing trouble.""  Jerton had visions of harassed railway officials and distraught Kestrel-Smiths, but he made no attempt to clothe his mental picture in words. The lady continued her story.  ""Naturally, none of my keys would fit the things, but I told an intelligent page boy that I had lost my key-ring, and he had the locks forced in a twinkling. Rather too intelligent, that boy; he will probably end in Dartmoor. The Kestrel-Smith toilet tools aren't up to much, but they are better than nothing.""  ""If you feel sure that you have a title,"" said Jerton, "" why not get hold of a peerage and go right through it?""  ""I tried that. I skimmed through the list of the House of Lords in 'Whitaker,' but a mere printed string of names conveys awfully little to one, you know. If you were an army officer and had lost your identity you might pore over the Army List for months without finding out who your were. ",comedy,humorous ,"Jerton, Lady Kestrel-Smit, Page boy","NARRATOR: 
Jerton stood awkwardly in the hotel lobby, his expression a mix of confusion and amusement. He never expected his day to include solving a stranger's memory loss. Lady Somebody, her hair in disarray, recounts her story with a touch of humor, her words punctuated by the sounds of bustling hotel guests and clinking glasses. The smell of freshly brewed coffee and the sight of sunlight streaming through the lobby windows add to the absurdity of the situation.

"""There is a wild beast in your woods,"" said the artist Cunningham, as he was being driven to the station. It was the only remark he had made during the drive, but as Van Cheele had talked incessantly his companion's silence had not been noticeable.  ""A stray fox or two and some resident weasels. Nothing more formidable,"" said Van Cheele. The artist said nothing.  ""What did you mean about a wild beast?"" said Van Cheele later, when they were on the platform.  ""Nothing. My imagination. Here is the train,"" said Cunningham.  That afternoon Van Cheele went for one of his frequent rambles through his woodland property. He had a stuffed bittern in his study, and knew the names of quite a number of wild flowers, so his aunt had possibly some justification in describing him as a great naturalist. At any rate, he was a great walker. It was his custom to take mental notes of everything he saw during his walks, not so much for the purpose of assisting contemporary science as to provide topics for conversation afterwards. When the bluebells began to show themselves in flower he made a point of informing every one of the fact; the season of the year might have warned his hearers of the likelihood of such an occurrence, but at least they felt that he was being absolutely frank with them.  What Van Cheele saw on this particular afternoon was, however, something far removed from his ordinary range of experience. On a shelf of smooth stone overhanging a deep pool in the hollow of an oak coppice a boy of about sixteen lay asprawl, drying his wet brown limbs luxuriously in the sun. His wet hair, parted by a recent dive, lay close to his head, and his light-brown eyes, so light that there was an almost tigerish gleam in them, were turned towards Van Cheele with a certain lazy watchfulness. It was an unexpected apparition, and Van Cheele found himself engaged in the novel process of thinking before he spoke. Where on earth could this wild-looking boy hail from? The miller's wife had lost a child some two months ago, supposed to have been swept away by the mill-race, but that had been a mere baby, not a half-grown lad.  ""What are you doing there?"" he demanded.  ",mystery,suspenseful,"Van Cheele, Artist Cunningham, Wild boy","NARRATOR: 
The woods were quiet, save for the rustling of leaves as Van Cheele made his way through the dense undergrowth. The air was thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, as the sun struggled to break through the canopy of trees. Van Cheele's heart was racing, his mind filled with a sense of unease as he recalled Cunningham's words about a wild beast lurking in these very woods. Suddenly, a figure appeared before him, a boy of about sixteen, sprawled on a shelf of smooth stone, his light-brown eyes glinting with a tigerish gleam. Who was he? Where had he come from? Van Cheele's mind was racing, his senses on high alert as he demanded an explanation from the mysterious boy.

VAN CHEELE: 
(action) 
What are you doing there?

V.O. (Van Cheele) What are you doing there? Is he the beast Cunningham warned me about? My heart is racing, the air thick with fear and uncertainty. Who is this boy? Why is he here? My mind is racing, searching for answers. I must be cautious, my senses on high alert.

WILD BOY: 
(action) 
Looks like I'm drying off after a swim.

VAN CHEELE: 
(surprised) 
A swim? In these woods?

WILD BOY: 
(smiling) 
Why not? The water's lovely and cool.

VAN CHEELE: 
(suspicious) 
But how did you get here? This is my property.

WILD BOY: 
(leans back) 
Oh, I've been wandering these woods for a while now. It's a perfect place to explore.

VAN CHEELE: 
(curious) 
But where did you come from? I've never seen you around here before.

WILD BOY: 
(mysterious) 
I've been here all along. Watching and waiting.

V.O. (Wild Boy) Who is this man? Why is he here? Watching and waiting. I've been here all along, hidden in the shadows. The woods are my home, my sanctuary. But this man, he brings danger. I must stay hidden, protect myself. But I can't help but be curious. Who is he? What does he want?

VAN CHEELE: 
(unsettled) 
Watching and waiting? For what?

WILD BOY: 
(smirking) 
For someone like you to come along.

V.O. (Wild Boy) What is this guy's problem? Smirking at me like he knows something. Probably thinks he's some kind of wild boy, untamed and free. I bet he's never even left these woods. But why does he seem so familiar? And why do I feel like I should be afraid?

NARRATOR: 
Van Cheele couldn't shake off the feeling of unease that the wild boy's words had instilled in him. There was something about this boy that was both intriguing and unsettling.

VAN CHEELE: 
(suspicious) 
You seem to know a lot about me. Who are you?

WILD BOY: 
(calmly) 
Just a boy who loves the wild and all its secrets.

VAN CHEELE: 
(leaning forward) 
But you must have a name.

V.O. (Van Cheele) ""But you must have a name,"" Van Cheele repeated, leaning forward. Who was this boy, and what was he doing here? Was he the wild beast Cunningham had warned about? Van Cheele's heart raced as he tried to make sense of the situation. He needed answers, and he needed them now.

WILD BOY: 
(mischievously) 
Oh, I have many names. But you can call me the Wild Boy.

VAN CHEELE: 
(intrigued) 
The Wild Boy? What a fitting name for someone who seems to have appeared out of nowhere.

V.O. (Van Cheele) ""The Wild Boy...such an intriguing name. Who is he? Where did he come from? My mind races with questions as I make my way through the quiet woods. Cunningham's warning echoes in my head. Could this boy be the wild beast he spoke of? I must proceed with caution.""

NARRATOR: 
Van Cheele couldn't help but be drawn to the enigmatic Wild Boy. There was something about him that sparked a sense of adventure and curiosity in Van Cheele's heart.

VAN CHEELE: 
(excitedly) 
Tell me, Wild Boy. What other secrets do these woods hold?

WILD BOY: 
(smiling) 
Oh, there are many. But only for those who are brave enough to seek them out.

VAN CHEELE: 
(determined) 
I am not afraid. Show me.

NARRATOR: 
And so, the two embarked on a journey through the woods, discovering hidden treasures and unexpected wonders. Van Cheele had found a kindred spirit in the Wild Boy, and together, they explored the mysteries of the woods. As the sun began to set, they returned to the shelf of smooth stone where they had first met.

VAN CHEELE: 
(grateful) 
Thank you, Wild Boy. I never knew these woods held so much beauty and wonder.

V.O. (Van Cheele) Gratefulness washed over Van Cheele as he gazed upon the beauty and wonder of the woods. The fear and unease that had gripped him moments ago dissipated, replaced by a sense of awe and appreciation. Who was this Wild Boy? Where had he come from? Van Cheele's mind raced with questions, but for now, he was content to simply bask in the magic of the moment.

WILD BOY: 
(smiling) 
It was my pleasure, Van Cheele. I knew you would appreciate the wildness of these woods.

V.O. (Wild Boy) Wow, Van Cheele is really impressed. I knew he would be. These woods are my home, I know every inch of them. It's exhilarating to see someone appreciate their wildness like I do. But who is this guy? Why is he here? I can sense his unease, but I won't give him an explanation just yet. Let him wonder.

NARRATOR: 
And with that, the Wild Boy disappeared into the depths of the woods, leaving Van Cheele with a newfound appreciation for the wild and all its secrets. As he made his way back home, his mind was filled with stories to share and memories to treasure. And from that day on, the woods were no longer a place of fear, but a place of adventure and wonder for Van Cheele.

"Langdon strode silently behind Vittoria and Kohler as they moved back into the main atrium where Langdon’s bizarre visit had begun. Vittoria’s legs drove in fluid efficiency—like an Olympic diver—a potency, Langdon figured, no doubt born from the flexibility and control of yoga. He could hear her breathing slowly and deliberately, as if somehow trying to filter her grief. Langdon wanted to say something to her, offer his sympathy. He too had once felt the abrupt hollowness of unexpectedly losing a parent. He remembered the funeral mostly, rainy and gray. Two days after his twelfth birthday. The house was filled with gray-suited men from the office, men who squeezed his hand too hard when they shook it. They were all mumbling words like cardiac and stress. His mother joked through teary eyes that she’d always been able to follow the stock market simply by holding her husband’s hand . . . his pulse her own private ticker tape. Once, when his father was alive, Langdon had heard his mom begging his father to “stop and smell the roses.” That year, Langdon bought his father a tiny blown glass rose for Christmas. It was the most beautiful thing Langdon had ever seen . . . the way the sun caught it, throwing a rainbow of colors on the wall. “It’s lovely,” his father had said when he opened it, kissing Robert on the forehead. “Let’s find a safe spot for it.” Then his father had carefully placed the rose on a high dusty shelf in the darkest corner of the living room. A few days later, Langdon got a stool, retrieved the rose, and took it back to the store. His father never noticed it was gone. The ping of an elevator pulled Langdon back to the present. Vittoria and Kohler were in front of him, boarding the lift. Langdon hesitated outside the open doors. “Is something wrong?” Kohler asked, sounding more impatient than concerned. “Not at all,” Langdon said, forcing himself toward the cramped carriage. He only used elevators when absolutely necessary. He preferred the more open spaces of stairwells. “Dr. Vetra’s lab is subterranean,” Kohler said. Wonderful, Langdon thought as he stepped across the cleft, feeling an icy wind churn up from the depths of the shaft. The doors closed, and the car began to descend. “Six stories,” Kohler said blankly, like an analytical engine. Langdon pictured the darkness of the empty shaft below them. He tried to block it out by staring at the numbered display of changing floors. ",fiction,suspenseful,"Robert Langdon, Vittoria Vetra, Maximilian Kohler, Bob Brownell, Charles Pratt","NARRATOR:

Langdon trailed behind Vittoria and Kohler, their movements fluid and efficient as they made their way back into the main atrium.

He could hear her steady breathing, a desperate attempt to filter out her grief. Langdon wanted to offer his condolences, having experienced the same sudden loss of a parent himself. The memory of his father's funeral, the gray-suited men and his mother's teary jokes, flooded his mind. The ping of the elevator brought him back to the present, but as they descended six stories into the subterranean lab, Langdon couldn't shake off the feeling of unease, the icy wind from the empty shaft below haunting him.

Vittoria gave him a grateful smile, and Langdon knew that they were in this together. As the elevator reached their destination, they stepped out into the subterranean lab.

I don't need your help. We have a team of experts working on this case.

Vittoria's words echoed in his mind, urging him to put their differences aside. He knew she was right, Vittoria's father deserved justice.

CHARLES PRATT:

Fine. But stay out of our way.

As they began to examine the lab for any clues, Langdon couldn't help but think about his own father. He remembered the tiny blown glass rose he had given him for Christmas, and how his father had never even noticed it was gone. But amidst the sadness, he also remembered the precious moments they had shared, and he knew that he needed to cherish every moment with the people he loved.

ROBERT LANGDON: 
(softly) 
Let's find the killer and make sure no one else has to suffer like Vittoria and I have.

""No, I'm not,"" said George. ""You ask Mother. If you're not going to believe what I say I won't tell you another word more. But I don't tell untruths. I think it's being a coward if you don't tell the truth— and I'm not a coward."" Julian remembered that Aunt Fanny had said that George was absolutely truthful, and he scratched his head and looked at George again. How could she be possibly telling the truth? ""Well, of course we'll believe you if you tell us the truth,"" he said. ""But it does sound a bit extraordinary, you know. Really it does. Children don't usually own islands, even funny little ones like that."" ""It isn't a funny little island,"" said George, fiercely. ""It's lovely. There are rabbits there, as tame as can be— and the big cormorants sit on the other side— and all kinds of gulls go there. The castle is wonderful too, even if it is all in ruins.""

JULIAN: 
(remembering Aunt Fanny's words) 
Tell us the truth.

GEORGE: 
(softening) 
It's a lovely place, with rabbits and cormorants and gulls. And the castle, even in ruins, is still wonderful.

Sorry, George. Go on, tell us.

GEORGE: 
(sitting down) 
Well, it all started when I was exploring the island one day. I stumbled upon a hidden cave and inside, I found a map. It was a map of the island, and it had a big X marked in one corner.

JULIAN: 
(curiously) 
An X? What did it mean?

GEORGE: 
(smiling) 
It was a treasure map! And at the X, I found a chest filled with gold coins and jewels. I couldn't believe it. I was rich.

DICK: 
(amazed) 
Wow, George. That's incredible.

V.O. (Dick) Wow, George. That's incredible. I never would have guessed she owned an entire island. I mean, who does that? But she seems so sincere. Maybe I've been too quick to judge her. I should give her a chance. Plus, an island with rabbits and cormorants and a castle? Sounds like a dream come true.

GEORGE: 
(nodding) 
But that's not all. The map also had a note attached to it, written by my great-grandfather. He had discovered the island and named it Kirrin Island. And in his will, he left the island and all its treasures to me.

JULIAN: 
(astounded) 
That's amazing. But how did your great-grandfather come to own the island?

V.O. (Julian) ""Wow, I can't believe it. Kirrin Island belongs to George? It's hard to wrap my mind around it. But she seems so sincere and genuine. Maybe Aunt Fanny was right, we should give her a chance. I wonder what other secrets this island holds.""

He was a great adventurer, just like us. He sailed the seas and discovered many new lands. And when he found Kirrin Island, he fell in love with it and decided to make it his own.
