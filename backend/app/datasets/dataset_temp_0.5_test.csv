"Outside the wall, at the part of the grounds farthest from the public road, were a horse and a light wagon, waiting.  The work of excavation was not difficult: the earth with which the grave had been loosely filled a few hours before offered little resistance and was soon thrown out. Removal of the casket from its box was less easy, but it was taken out, for it was a perquisite of Jess, who carefully unscrewed the cover and laid it aside, exposing the body in black trousers and white shirt. At that instant the air sprang to flame, a cracking shock of thunder shook the stunned world and Henry Armstrong tranquilly sat up. With inarticulate cries the men fled in terror, each in a different direction. For nothing on earth could two of them have been persuaded to return. But Jess was of another breed.  In the grey of the morning the two students, pallid and haggard from anxiety and with the terror of their adventure still beating tumultuously in their blood, met at the medical college.  'You saw it?' cried one.  'God! yes -- what are we to do?'  They went around to the rear of the building, where they saw a horse, attached to a light wagon, hitched to a gatepost near the door of the dissecting-room. Mechanically they entered the room. On a bench in the obscurity sat the negro Jess. He rose, grinning, all eyes and teeth.  'I'm waiting for my pay,' he said.  Stretched naked on a long table lay the body of Henry Armstrong, the head defiled with blood and clay from a blow with a spade.",horror,suspenseful,"Jess, Henry Armstrong, Student 1, Student 2","NARRATOR: 
The grey light of dawn crept through the windows of the medical college, casting an eerie glow on the pale faces of the two students who had just arrived. They were exhausted, their eyes wide with terror from the events of the previous night. They had seen the impossible - a man rise from the dead. But now, in the cold light of day, they were faced with the gruesome reality of the body before them. Blood and dirt stained the once pristine white shirt, and the head was contorted in a grotesque expression. The room was silent except for the sound of the horse outside, waiting for its payment. And in the corner, grinning with all eyes and teeth, was the man responsible for this horror - Jess, the grave robber.

"The young woman's glance fell upon them with a distant, swift disinterest; then with a lovely smile brightening her countenance and a tender pink tingeing her rounded cheeks, she held out a little gray-gloved hand. When she spoke her voice, full, sweet, and deliberate, proclaimed that its owner was accustomed to speak and be heard.  ""Well, Mr. Easton, if you will make me speak first, I suppose I must. Don't you ever recognize old friends when you meet them in the West?""  The younger man roused himself sharply at the sound of her voice, seemed to struggle with a slight embarrassment which he threw off instantly, and then clasped her fingers with his left hand.  ""It's Miss Fairchild,"" he said, with a smile. ""I'll ask you to excuse the other hand; ""it's otherwise engaged just at present.""  He slightly raised his right hand, bound at the wrist by the shining ""bracelet"" to the left one of his companion. The glad look in the girl's eyes slowly changed to a bewildered horror. The glow faded from her cheeks. Her lips parted in a vague, relaxing distress. Easton, with a little laugh, as if amused, was about to speak again when the other forestalled him. The glum-faced man had been watching the girl's countenance with veiled glances from his keen, shrewd eyes.  ""You'll excuse me for speaking, miss, but, I see you're acquainted with the marshal here. If you'll ask him to speak a word for me when we get to the pen he'll do it, and it'll make things easier for me there. He's taking me to Leavenworth prison. It's seven years for counterfeiting.""

"The children were at play in their play-ground one day, when a herald rode through the town, blowing a trumpet, and crying aloud, ""The King! the King passes by this road to-day. Make ready for the King!"" The children stopped their play, and looked at one another.  ""Did you hear that?"" they said. ""The King is coming. He may look over the wall and see our playground; who knows? We must put it in order.""  The playground was sadly dirty, and in the corners were scraps of paper and broken toys, for these were careless children. But now, one brought a hoe, and another a rake, and a third ran to fetch the wheelbarrow from behind the garden gate. They labored hard, till at length all was clean and tidy.  ""Now it is clean!"" they said; ""but we must make it pretty, too, for kings are used to fine things; maybe he would not notice mere cleanness, for he may have it all the time.""  Then one brought sweet rushes and strewed them on the ground; and others made garlands of oak leaves and pine tassels and hung them on the walls; and the littlest one pulled marigold buds and threw them all about the playground, ""to look like gold,"" he said.  When all was done the playground was so beautiful that the children stood and looked at it, and clapped their hands with pleasure.  ""Let us keep it always like this!"" said the littlest one; and the others cried, ""Yes! yes! that is what we will do.""  They waited all day for the coming of the King, but he never came; only, towards sunset, a man with travel-worn clothes, and a kind, tired face passed along the road, and stopped to look over the wall.",drama,optimistic,"Herald, Children, Man with travel-worn clothes","HERALD:

"Out of the drawer they took about ten little packages of yellow paper, tied with care and arranged one beside the other. They threw these relics on the bed and chose one of them on which the word ""Father"" was written. They opened and read it.  It was one of those old-fashioned letters which one finds in old family desk drawers, those epistles which smell of another century. The first one started: ""My dear,"" another one: ""My beautiful little girl,"" others: ""My dear child,"" or: ""My dear daughter."" And suddenly the nun began to read aloud, to read over to the dead woman her whole history, all her tender memories. The judge, resting his elbow on the bed, was listening with his eyes fastened on his mother. The motionless body seemed happy.  Sister Eulalie, interrupting herself, said suddenly:  ""These ought to be put in the grave with her; they ought to be used as a shroud and she ought to be buried in it."" She took another package, on which no name was written. She began to read in a firm voice: ""My adored one, I love you wildly. Since yesterday I have been suffering the tortures of the damned, haunted by our memory. I feel your lips against mine, your eyes in mine, your breast against mine. I love you, I love you! You have driven me mad. My arms open, I gasp, moved by a wild desire to hold you again. My whole soul and body cries out for you, wants you. I have kept in my mouth the taste of your kisses--""  The judge had straightened himself up. The nun stopped reading. He snatched the letter from her and looked for the signature. There was none, but only under the words, ""The man who adores you,"" the name ""Henry."" Their father's name was Rene. Therefore this was not from him. The son then quickly rummaged through the package of letters, took one out and read: ""I can no longer live without your caresses."" Standing erect, severe as when sitting on the bench, he looked unmoved at the dead woman. The nun, straight as a statue, tears trembling in the corners of her eyes, was watching her brother, waiting. Then he crossed the room slowly, went to the window and stood there, gazing out into the dark night.  When he turned around again Sister Eulalie, her eyes dry now, was still standing near the bed, her head bent down.",drama,serious,"Sister Eulalie,  Judge, Dead woman, Henry","NARRATOR: 
The judge's chambers are dimly lit, the only source of light coming from a lone lamp on the desk. The room is quiet, save for the rustling of paper as the judge and Sister Eulalie sift through the old letters. The air is heavy with the smell of aged paper, a scent that transports them back in time. As they read, memories flood back to them, memories of a time long gone.

She was a woman of many layers, my dear brother. And now, we have the privilege of uncovering them.

These letters must be buried with her. They are a testament to the passionate woman she truly was.

"When Hughie came in he found Trevor putting the finishing touches to a wonderful life-size picture of a beggar-man. The beggar himself was standing on a raised platform in a corner of the studio. He was a wizened old man, with a face like wrinkled parchment, and a most piteous expression. Over his shoulders was flung a coarse brown cloak, all tears and tatters; his thick boots were patched and cobbled, and with one hand he leant on a rough stick, while with the other he held out his battered hat for alms.  'What an amazing model!' whispered Hughie, as he shook hands with his friend.  'An amazing model?' shouted Trevor at the top of his voice; 'I should think so! Such beggars as he are not to be met with every day. A trouvaille, mort cher; a living Velasquez! My stars! what an etching Rembrandt would have made of him!'  'Poor old chap! said Hughie, 'how miserable he looks! But I suppose, to you painters, his face is his fortune?'  'Certainly,' replied Trevor, 'you don't want a beggar to look happy, do you?'  'How much does a model get for sitting?' asked Hughie, as he found himself a comfortable seat on a divan.  'A shilling an hour.'  'And how much do you get for your picture, Alan?'  'Oh, for this I get two thousand!'  'Pounds?'  'Guineas. Painters, poets, and physicians always get guineas.'  'Well, I think the model should have a percentage,' cried Hughie, laughing; 'they work quite as hard as you do.'  'Nonsense, nonsense! Why, look at the trouble of laying on the paint alone, and standing all day long at one's easel! It's all very well, Hughie, for you to talk, but I assure you that there are moments when Art almost attains to the dignity of manual labour. But you mustn't chatter; I'm very busy. Smoke a cigarette, and keep quiet.'  After some time the servant came in, and told Trevor that the frame-maker wanted to speak to him.",comedy,humorous ,"Hughie, Trevor, Beggar-man, Servant, Frame-maker","NARRATOR: 
Hughie enters the art studio and finds Trevor working on a life-size painting of a beggar-man. The model stands on a raised platform in the corner, his wizened face and tattered clothes adding to his piteous expression.

TREVOR: 
(puts finishing touches on painting) 
What do you think, Hughie? A masterpiece, isn't it?

HUGHIE: 
(amazed) 
Wow, Trevor! That's incredible! The beggar looks so lifelike.

TREVOR: 
(smugly) 
Of course he does. He's a living Velasquez, a trouvaille. I struck gold with this one.

HUGHIE: 
(concerned) 
But he looks so miserable. Does he really have to stand there all day?

TREVOR: 
(brushes off concern) 
Oh, Hughie, you don't understand the world of art. A beggar's face is his fortune. And besides, he's getting paid a shilling an hour. Not bad for a day's work.

V.O. (Trevor) Why is Hughie so concerned about the beggar? He doesn't understand the world of art. A shilling an hour is a fair wage for a day's work. Besides, painting is almost as difficult as manual labor. I'm not exploiting the beggar, I'm giving him an opportunity.

HUGHIE: 
(jokingly) 
I think he deserves a percentage. After all, he's working just as hard as you are.

TREVOR: 
(laughs) 
Nonsense, Hughie. Painting is almost as difficult as manual labor. But enough chit-chat, I have work to do.

NARRATOR: 
As Trevor continues to work, the servant interrupts to inform him that the frame-maker is waiting.

SERVANT: 
(excitedly) 
Trevor, the frame-maker is here! He's been waiting to speak with you.

TREVOR: 
(excitedly) 
Ah, finally! I've been waiting for him. He's a master craftsman, you know. His frames are highly sought after by artists and collectors alike.

V.O. (Trevor) ""Wow, this is it. Hughie's finally here. I can't wait to show him my latest masterpiece. The model is perfect, his expression so pitiful and real. I can't believe I get to work with such a talented frame-maker. I'm so grateful for this opportunity.""

NARRATOR: 
Trevor rushes over to speak with the frame-maker, leaving Hughie alone in the studio.

HUGHIE: 
(to himself) 
I can't believe he's making thousands from this painting, while the poor beggar only gets a shilling an hour. It just doesn't seem right.

NARRATOR: 
As Hughie ponders this, the beggar-man suddenly speaks up.

HUGHIE: 
(surprised) 
You can talk?

HUGHIE: 
(amused) 
Well, I think you're doing a great job. You're the star of the show, after all.

V.O. (Hughie) Hughie enters the art studio and finds Trevor working on a life-size painting of a beggar-man. The model stands on a raised platform in the corner, his wizened face and tattered clothes adding to his piteous expression. Trevor introduces him as a ""living Velasquez"" and a ""trouvaille."" Hughie can't help but feel sorry for the old man, but Trevor assures him that a miserable face is essential for a beggar. As they chat, Trevor reveals that he pays the model a shilling an hour, while he himself earns two thousand guineas for the painting. Hughie jokes that the model deserves a percentage for his hard work, but Trevor dismisses it, claiming that painting is almost as difficult as manual labor. As they continue talking, the servant interrupts to inform Trevor that the frame-maker is waiting.

As I watch Trevor work on his masterpiece, I can't help but feel a twinge of guilt. Here I am, enjoying the fruits of his labor, while the model stands there, earning a mere shilling an hour. But as Trevor says, painting is no easy task. I should just enjoy the show.

NARRATOR: 
The beggar-man returns to his platform, and Hughie watches as Trevor and the frame-maker discuss the perfect frame for the painting.

TREVOR: 
(grinning) 
Excellent! I can't wait to see it.

NARRATOR: 
As the frame-maker gets to work, Hughie turns to the beggar-man.

HUGHIE: 
(smiling) 
You know, I think you should get a cut of Trevor's earnings. Without you, there would be no painting.

HUGHIE: 
(understanding) 
I see. Well, I hope Trevor appreciates your sacrifice.

NARRATOR: 
As the day comes to an end, Trevor proudly unveils his finished painting to Hughie.

TREVOR: 
(excitedly) 
Ta-da! What do you think, Hughie?

HUGHIE: 
(amazed) 
It's beautiful, Trevor. You truly are a master.

TREVOR: 
(smiling) 
And you, my dear friend, are a wonderful model. Thank you for your hard work and dedication.

HUGHIE: 
(smiling) 
No, thank you for showing me the true value of art and the people behind it.

NARRATOR: 
As the friends say their goodbyes, Hughie can't help but feel grateful for the lesson he learned from the beggar-man and Trevor's masterpiece. Sometimes, the true beauty of art lies not in the painting itself, but in the stories and people that inspire it.

"He seemed unwilling to leave anything to the imagination of a casual observer, and his talk grew presently personal and introspective.  ""I don't know how it is,"" he told his friend, ""I'm not much over forty, but I seem to have settled down into a deep groove of elderly middle-age. My sister shows the same tendency. We like everything to be exactly in its accustomed place; we like things to happen exactly at their appointed times; we like everything to be usual, orderly, punctual, methodical, to a hair's breadth, to a minute. It distresses and upsets us if it is not so. For instance, to take a very trifling matter, a thrush has built its nest year after year in the catkin- tree on the lawn; this year, for no obvious reason, it is building in the ivy on the garden wall. We have said very little about it, but I think we both feel that the change is unnecessary, and just a little irritating.""  ""Perhaps,"" said the friend, ""it is a different thrush.""  ""We have suspected that,"" said J. P. Huddle, ""and I think it gives us even more cause for annoyance. We don't feel that we want a change of thrush at our time of life; and yet, as I have said, we have scarcely reached an age when these things should make themselves seriously felt.""  ""What you want,"" said the friend, ""is an Unrest-cure.""  ""An Unrest-cure? I've never heard of such a thing.""  ""You've heard of Rest-cures for people who've broken down under stress of too much worry and strenuous living; well, you're suffering from overmuch repose and placidity, and you need the opposite kind of treatment.""  ""But where would one go for such a thing?""  ""Well, you might stand as an Orange candidate for Kilkenny, or do a course of district visiting in one of the Apache quarters of Paris, or give lectures in Berlin to prove that most of Wagner's music was written by Gambetta; and there's always the interior of Morocco to travel in. But, to be really effective, the Unrest-cure ought to be tried in the home. How you would do it I haven't the faintest idea.""",comedy,humorous ,"J. P. Huddle, Friend","NARRATOR: 
J. P. Huddle's living room is a picture of perfect order and precision. The furniture is arranged just so, the curtains hang in neat pleats, and everything is spotlessly clean. J. P. Huddle himself is a man in his forties, but he seems to have settled into a deep groove of elderly middle-age. He and his sister are creatures of habit, and any deviation from their usual routine causes them great distress. Even something as trivial as a thrush building its nest in a different spot can throw them off balance.

FRIEND: 
(smiling) 
Perhaps the thrush is looking for a change of scenery.

FRIEND: 
(suggestively) 
Well, perhaps what you need is an Unrest-cure.

FRIEND: 
(explaining) 
It's the opposite of a Rest-cure. Instead of taking a break from stress and worry, you need to shake things up a bit.

FRIEND: 
(suggesting) 
You could always run for office in Kilkenny or do some volunteer work in a rough neighborhood. Or, for a real challenge, you could give lectures in Berlin on the true authorship of Wagner's music.

FRIEND: 
(thoughtfully) 
But for the Unrest-cure to really be effective, it should be done in the comfort of your own home.

V.O. (Friend) ```
FRIEND: But for the Unrest-cure to really be effective, it should be done in the comfort of your own home.

(Thoughtfully) A change of scenery would certainly be nice, but I can't imagine leaving this perfectly ordered haven. Maybe there's a way to shake things up without disrupting the peace. Perhaps a new hobby or a different routine. I'll have to think about it...

FRIEND: 
(smirking) 
Oh, I'm sure you'll find a way. Maybe you could start by rearranging your furniture or trying a new recipe for dinner.

FRIEND: 
(laughing) 
Exactly. It's time to shake things up, my friend.

NARRATOR: 
And so, J. P. Huddle and his friend set out on a journey to break free from their mundane routines and embrace the chaos of life. Will they succeed in their Unrest-cure, or will they return to their orderly ways? Only time will tell. But for now, the calm and orderly atmosphere of their living room remains undisturbed.

"Filled with amazement and terror by this apparition of a horseman in the sky--half believing himself the chosen scribe of some new Apocalypse, the officer was overcome by the intensity of his emotions; his legs failed him and he fell. Almost at the same instant he heard a crashing sound in the trees--a sound that died without an echo--and all was still.  The officer rose to his feet, trembling. The familiar sensation of an abraded shin recalled his dazed faculties. Pulling himself together he ran rapidly obliquely away from the cliff to a point distant from its foot; thereabout he expected to find his man; and thereabout he naturally failed. In the fleeting instant of his vision his imagination had been so wrought upon by the apparent grace and ease and intention of the marvelous performance that it did not occur to him that the line of march of arial cavalry is directly downward, and that he could find the objects of his search at the very foot of the cliff. A half-hour later he returned to camp.  This officer was a wise man; he knew better than to tell an incredible truth. He said nothing of what he had seen. But when the commander asked him if in his scout he had learned anything of advantage to the expedition he answered:  ""Yes, sir; there is no road leading down into this valley from the southward.""  The commander, knowing better, smiled.  After firing his shot, Private Carter Druse reloaded his rifle and resumed his watch. Ten minutes had hardly passed when a Federal sergeant crept cautiously to him on hands and knees. Druse neither turned his head nor looked at him, but lay without motion or sign of recognition.  ""Did you fire?"" the sergeant whispered.  ""Yes.""  ""At what?""  ""A horse. It was standing on yonder rock--pretty far out. You see it is no longer there. It went over the cliff.""  The man's face was white, but he showed no other sign of emotion. Having answered, he turned away his eyes and said no more. The sergeant did not understand.  ""See here, Druse,"" he said, after a moment's silence, ""it's no use making a mystery. I order you to report. Was there anybody on the horse?""  ""Yes.""  ""Well?""  ""My father.""  The sergeant rose to his feet and walked away. ""Good God!"" he said.",drama,suspenseful,"Officer, commander, Private Carter Druse, Federal sergeant","NARRATOR:

"That night the city wore the mask of a capital. The five young men strolled along Stephen's Green in a faint cloud of aromatic smoke. They talked loudly and gaily and their cloaks dangled from their shoulders. The people made way for them. At the corner of Grafton Street a short fat man was putting two handsome ladies on a car in charge of another fat man. The car drove off and the short fat man caught sight of the party.  ""Andre.""  ""It's Farley!""  A torrent of talk followed. Farley was an American. No one knew very well what the talk was about. Villona and Riviere were the noisiest, but all the men were excited.

They proceeded towards it with linked arms, singing Cadet Roussel in chorus, stamping their feet at every:  ""Ho! Ho! Hohe, vraiment!""  They got into a rowboat at the slip and made out for the American's yacht. There was to be supper, music, cards. Villona said with conviction:  ""It is delightful!""  There was a yacht piano in the cabin. Villona played a waltz for Farley and Riviere, Farley acting as cavalier and Riviere as lady. Then an impromptu square dance, the men devising original figures.

"Picture followed picture against the grey background. Now Nellie saw herself one winter night knocking at the door of Stepan Lukitch, the district doctor. The old dog hoarsely and lazily barked behind the gate. The doctor's windows were in darkness. All was silence.  ""For God's sake, for God's sake!"" whispered Nellie.  But at last the garden gate creaked and Nellie saw the doctor's cook.  ""Is the doctor at home?""  ""His honour's asleep,"" whispered the cook into her sleeve, as though afraid of waking her master.  ""He's only just got home from his fever patients, and gave orders he was not to be waked.""  But Nellie scarcely heard the cook. Thrusting her aside, she rushed headlong into the doctor's house.

I was so pleased to see him that I thought I should never have done wringing his hand.  I said to him --""My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met. How remarkably well you are looking to-day.

V.O. (Fortunato) I can't believe it's been so long since I've seen my dear NARRATOR. I'm so excited to catch up with my friend. But something about Fortunato's appearance and his talk of Amontillado makes me uneasy. I hope he's not leading me into trouble.

NARRATOR: 
(smiling) 
I am well, FORTUNATO. And how have you been?

FORTUNATO: 
(grinning) 
I have been indulging in the pleasures of the carnival, my friend. And I have made a most fortunate discovery.

V.O. (Fortunato) Fortunato's grinning face belied his true intentions. The carnival had driven him mad, and now he was obsessed with this Amontillado. But I couldn't shake the feeling of unease that crept over me. I knew this was a dangerous game, but I couldn't resist.

NARRATOR: 
(curious) 
Oh? Pray tell, what have you found?

FORTUNATO: 
(smirking) 
The elusive Amontillado, my dear NARRATOR. A pipe of it, to be exact.

NARRATOR: 
(skeptical) 
Amontillado? In the middle of the carnival? I have my doubts, FORTUNATO.

FORTUNATO: 
(defensively) 
Doubts? Impossible! And I have already paid the full Amontillado price for it.

NARRATOR: 
(apologetically) 
I apologize, FORTUNATO. I should have consulted you first. But I couldn't resist the bargain.

FORTUNATO: 
(grinning) 
Of course not. But let us not waste any more time. We must taste this Amontillado at once.

NARRATOR: 
(reluctant) 
I'm afraid I cannot, FORTUNATO. I have made plans with LUCHRESI.

FORTUNATO: 
(dismissively) 
LUCHRESI? He cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.

NARRATOR: 
(defending) 
But some say his taste is a match for your own.

FORTUNATO: 
(determined) 
Come, my friend. Let us go to your vaults and taste this Amontillado. I must know the truth.

NARRATOR: 
(resigned) 
Very well, FORTUNATO. Lead the way.

NARRATOR: 
(narrating) 
The vaults were dark and damp, encrusted with nitre. The cold was unbearable, but FORTUNATO seemed unaffected. His excitement for the Amontillado was palpable.

FORTUNATO: 
(excitedly) 
Ah, here it is! The Amontillado!

NARRATOR: 
(narrating) 
But as I peered into the barrel, I saw no Amontillado. Instead, I saw a figure lurking in the shadows.

FORTUNATO: 
(suspicious) 
What is the meaning of this, NARRATOR?

NARRATOR: 
(smirking) 
The Amontillado, FORTUNATO. It is here, in these walls.

FORTUNATO: 
(panicking) 
What are you doing, NARRATOR? Let me out!

NARRATOR: 
(smirking) 
I'm afraid not, FORTUNATO. You have wronged me, and now you must pay the price.

FORTUNATO: 
(desperately) 
LUCHRESI! Help me, LUCHRESI!

NARRATOR: 
(narrating) 
But LUCHRESI was nowhere to be found. And as the last brick was placed, FORTUNATO's screams were silenced forever.

NARRATOR: 
(narrating) 
And that, my friends, is the tale of how I took revenge on FORTUNATO for his betrayal. But let us not dwell on such dark thoughts. The carnival awaits, and I have a new barrel of Amontillado to enjoy.

"The Skin Horse had lived longer in the nursery than any of the others. He was so old that his brown coat was bald in patches and showed the seams underneath, and most of the hairs in his tail had been pulled out to string bead necklaces. He was wise, for he had seen a long succession of mechanical toys arrive to boast and swagger, and by-and-by break their mainsprings and pass away, and he knew that they were only toys, and would never turn into anything else. For nursery magic is very strange and wonderful, and only those playthings that are old and wise and experienced like the Skin Horse understand all about it.  ""What is REAL?"" asked the Rabbit one day, when they were lying side by side near the nursery fender, before Nana came to tidy the room. ""Does it mean having things that buzz inside you and a stick-out handle?""  ""Real isn't how you are made,"" said the Skin Horse. ""It's a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real.""  ""Does it hurt?"" asked the Rabbit.  ""Sometimes,"" said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful. ""When you are Real you don't mind being hurt.""  ""Does it happen all at once, like being wound up,"" he asked, ""or bit by bit?""  ""It doesn't happen all at once,"" said the Skin Horse. ""You become. It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand.""  ""I suppose you are Real?"" said the Rabbit. And then he wished he had not said it, for he thought the Skin Horse might be sensitive. But the Skin Horse only smiled.",fiction,optimistic,"Skin Horse, Rabbit, Nana","SKIN HORSE: 
(smiling) 
Real is something that happens to you. It's not something you can make yourself.

RABBIT: 
(leaning in, curious) 
What do you mean?

V.O. (Rabbit) ""What does it mean to be Real? I've always been told that I'm just a toy. But the Skin Horse seems to know something I don't. Maybe, just maybe, there's more to me than meets the eye. I wonder if I'll ever find out.""

SKIN HORSE: 
(wistfully) 
Being Real is about being loved by a child for a long time. It's a gradual process, but when it happens, you become something special.

V.O. (Skin Horse) Being Real is about being loved by a child for a long time. It's a gradual process, but when it happens, you become something special. I may be old and worn, but to the child, I am real and loved. That is all that matters.

RABBIT: 
(looking down at his worn fur) 
Does it hurt?

SKIN HORSE: 
(sighing) 
Sometimes, yes. But when you're Real, you don't mind being hurt.

RABBIT: 
(pondering) 
Is it like being wound up, or does it happen all at once?

V.O. (Rabbit) ""Is that what it takes to become Real? To be loved by a child for a long time? I've always wanted to be Real, but I never knew how. Maybe the Skin Horse can teach me. He's been here longer than anyone else. Maybe he can show me the way.""

SKIN HORSE: 
(smiling) 
It doesn't happen all at once. You become. It takes time. That's why it doesn't happen to toys that break easily or have sharp edges. It takes love and patience.

NARRATOR: 
The Skin Horse's words hung in the air, filling the nursery with a sense of wonder and magic. The Rabbit couldn't help but feel a twinge of excitement at the thought of becoming Real.

NANA: 
(entering the room) 
What are you two talking about?

SKIN HORSE: 
(looking up at Nana) 
Becoming Real.

NANA: 
(smiling knowingly) 
Ah, yes. I remember when I was just a new toy in this nursery. But now, after years of love and play, I am Real.

NARRATOR: 
Nana's words filled the Rabbit with hope and determination. He knew that one day, he too could become Real.

RABBIT: 
(looking at Nana and Skin Horse) 
Do you think I could become Real?

V.O. (Rabbit) ""Do I really want to become Real? It sounds like it can be painful, but the Skin Horse seems so wise and content. Maybe it's worth it to be loved by a child and become something more. I wonder if I have what it takes.""

SKIN HORSE: 
(nodding) 
Of course, my dear Rabbit. With time and love, anything is possible in the nursery.

NARRATOR: 
And so, the Rabbit continued his journey towards becoming Real, with the guidance and wisdom of the Skin Horse and Nana by his side. In the nursery, where magic and love reigned supreme, anything was possible.

"I walked and walked along the cold wet sand, making my chattering teeth warble in honour of cold and hunger, when suddenly, as I was carefully searching for something to eat behind one of the empty crates, I perceived behind it, crouching on the ground, a figure in woman's clothes dank with the rain and clinging fast to her stooping shoulders. Standing over her, I watched to see what she was doing. It appeared that she was digging a trench in the sand with her hands--digging away under one of the crates.  ""Why are you doing that?"" I asked, crouching down on my heels quite close to her.  She gave a little scream and was quickly on her legs again. Now that she stood there staring at me, with her wide-open grey eyes full of terror, I perceived that it was a girl of my own age, with a very pleasant face embellished unfortunately by three large blue marks. This spoilt her, although these blue marks had been distributed with a remarkable sense of proportion, one at a time, and all were of equal size--two under the eyes, and one a little bigger on the forehead just over the bridge of the nose. This symmetry was evidently the work of an artist well inured to the business of spoiling the human physiognomy.  The girl looked at me, and the terror in her eyes gradually died out... She shook the sand from her hands, adjusted her cotton head-gear, cowered down, and said:  ""I suppose you too want something to eat? Dig away then! My hands are tired. Over there""--she nodded her head in the direction of a booth--""there is bread for certain ... and sausages too... That booth is still carrying on business.""  I began to dig. She, after waiting a little and looking at me, sat down beside me and began to help me.  We worked in silence. I cannot say now whether I thought at that moment of the criminal code, of morality, of proprietorship, and all the other things about which, in the opinion of many experienced persons, one ought to think every moment of one's life. Wishing to keep as close to the truth as possible, I must confess that apparently I was so deeply engaged in digging under the crate that I completely forgot about everything else except this one thing: What could be inside that crate?  The evening drew on. ",fiction,mysterious,"Narrator, Girl","NARRATOR: 
The cold, wet sand clung to my feet as I trudged along the desolate beach, my teeth chattering in the biting wind. Hunger gnawed at my stomach, driving me to scavenge for food. As I searched behind an empty crate, I spotted a figure crouched on the ground in tattered women's clothes, digging frantically with her hands.

GIRL: 
(startled) 
Why are you doing that?

I won't hurt you. I'm just looking for something to eat.

(relieved) 
Oh, thank goodness. I thought you were going to rob me.

NARRATOR:

Why would you think that?

GIRL: 
(sadly) 
Because everyone else does. They see my blue marks and they think I'm a criminal.

V.O. (Girl) Why do they judge me based on my appearance? I didn't choose these marks. I didn't choose to be an outcast. But I can't blame them for being afraid. I'm afraid too. Afraid of being alone, of never fitting in. But maybe this girl understands. Maybe we can be friends.

NARRATOR: 
(puzzled) 
What do the blue marks mean?

(explaining) 
They're a punishment. I was caught stealing food and the owner of the booth marked me as a warning to others.

That's not right. No one should have to suffer for trying to survive.

Dark rainclouds were gathering from the east, and bringing from time to time a breath of moisture in the air.  Kukin, who was the manager of an open-air theatre called the Tivoli, and who lived in the lodge, was standing in the middle of the garden looking at the sky.  ""Again!"" he observed despairingly. ""It's going to rain again! Rain every day, as though to spite me. I might as well hang myself! It's ruin! Fearful losses every day.""

"Mr. Pneumonia was not what you would call a chivalric old gentleman. A mite of a little woman with blood thinned by California zephyrs was hardly fair game for the red-fisted, short-breathed old duffer. But Johnsy he smote; and she lay, scarcely moving, on her painted iron bedstead, looking through the small Dutch window-panes at the blank side of the next brick house.  One morning the busy doctor invited Sue into the hallway with a shaggy, gray eyebrow.  ""She has one chance in - let us say, ten,"" he said, as he shook down the mercury in his clinical thermometer. "" And that chance is for her to want to live. This way people have of lining-u on the side of the undertaker makes the entire pharmacopoeia look silly. Your little lady has made up her mind that she's not going to get well. Has she anything on her mind?""  ""She - she wanted to paint the Bay of Naples some day."" said Sue.  ""Paint? - bosh! Has she anything on her mind worth thinking twice - a man for instance?""  ""A man?"" said Sue, with a jew's-harp twang in her voice. ""Is a man worth - but, no, doctor; there is nothing of the kind.""  ""Well, it is the weakness, then,"" said the doctor. ""I will do all that science, so far as it may filter through my efforts, can accomplish. But whenever my patient begins to count the carriages in her funeral procession I subtract 50 per cent from the curative power of medicines. If you will get her to ask one question about the new winter styles in cloak sleeves I will promise you a one-in-five chance for her, instead of one in ten.""

Johnsy lay, scarcely making a ripple under the bedclothes, with her face toward the window. Sue stopped whistling, thinking she was asleep.  She arranged her board and began a pen-and-ink drawing to illustrate a magazine story. Young artists must pave their way to Art by drawing pictures for magazine stories that young authors write to pave their way to Literature.

They often spent half the day side by side, rod in hand and feet dangling over the water, and a warm friendship had sprung up between the two.  Some days they did not speak; at other times they chatted; but they understood each other perfectly without the aid of words, having similar tastes and feelings.  In the spring, about ten o'clock in the morning, when the early sun caused a light mist to float on the water and gently warmed the backs of the two enthusiastic anglers, Morissot would occasionally remark to his neighbor:  ""My, but it's pleasant here.""  To which the other would reply:  ""I can't imagine anything better!""  And these few words sufficed to make them understand and appreciate each other.  In the autumn, toward the close of day, when the setting sun shed a blood-red glow over the western sky, and the reflection of the crimson clouds tinged the whole river with red, brought a glow to the faces of the two friends, and gilded the trees, whose leaves were already turning at the first chill touch of winter, Monsieur Sauvage would sometimes smile at Morissot, and say:  ""What a glorious spectacle!""  And Morissot would answer, without taking his eyes from his float:  ""This is much better than the boulevard, isn't it?""  As soon as they recognized each other they shook hands cordially, affected at the thought of meeting under such changed circumstances.  Monsieur Sauvage, with a sigh, murmured:  ""These are sad times!""  Morissot shook his head mournfully.  ""And such weather! This is the first fine day of the year.""  The sky was, in fact, of a bright, cloudless blue.  They walked along, side by side, reflective and sad.  ""And to think of the fishing!"" said Morissot. ""What good times we used to have!""  ""When shall we be able to fish again?"" asked Monsieur Sauvage.  They entered a small cafe and took an absinthe together, then resumed their walk along the pavement.  Morissot stopped suddenly.  ""Shall we have another absinthe?"" he said.  ""If you like,"" agreed Monsieur Sauvage.  And they entered another wine shop.

To a plainsman, or a man who has the instinct, these things are as nothing in comparison with the charm of the outdoor life, and the pleasing tingling of adventure. But woman is a creature wedded to comfort. She also has a strange instinctive desire to be entirely alone every once in a while, probably because her experiences, while not less numerous than man's, are mainly psychical, and she needs occasionally time to get ""thought up to date."" So Miss Caldwell began to get very impatient.  The afternoon of the sixth day Alfred, Miss Caldwell, and Allen rode along side by side. Alfred was telling a self-effacing story of adventure, and Miss Caldwell was listening carelessly because she had nothing else to do. Allen chaffed lazily when the fancy took him.  ""I happened to have a limb broken at the time,"" Alfred was observing, parenthetically, in his soft tones, ""and so----""  ""What kind of a limb?"" asked the young Easterner, with direct brutality. He glanced with a half-humourous aside at the girl, to whom the little man had been mainly addressing himself.  Alfred hesitated, blushed, lost the thread of his tale, and finally in great confusion reined back his horse by the harsh Spanish bit. He fell to the rear of the little wagon-train, where he hung his head, and went hot and cold by turns in thinking of such an indiscretion before a lady.  The young Easterner spurred up on the right of the girl's mount.  ""He's the queerest little fellow I ever saw!"" he observed, with a laugh. ""Sorry to spoil his story. Was it a good one?""  ""It might have been if you hadn't spoiled it,"" answered the girl, flicking her horse's ears mischievously. The animal danced. ""What did you do it for?""  ""Oh, just to see him squirm. He'll think about that all the rest of the afternoon, and will hardly dare look you in the face next time you meet.""  ""I know. Isn't he funny? The other morning he came around the corner of the wagon and caught me with my hair down. I wish you could have seen him!""  She laughed gayly at the memory.  ",drama,serious,"Alfred, Miss Caldwell, Allen","NARRATOR: 
The sun beat down mercilessly on the dusty plains, casting a hazy glare over the endless expanse. The wagon-train trudged along, the wheels creaking in rhythm with the horses' hooves. The air was hot and dry, the scent of sagebrush and sun-baked earth filling the nostrils.

[SFX : CREAKING]

ALFRED: 
(to Miss Caldwell) 
There is a great deal to recommend a plains journey at first. Later, there is nothing at all to recommend it.

MISS CALDWELL: 
(sighs) 
I know. This heat is unbearable.

ALLEN: 
(grinning) 
Come on, Miss Caldwell. Where is your sense of adventure?

V.O. (Allen) ```
Allen grinned, taking in the harsh landscape. He loved the thrill of adventure, the unknown. But Miss Caldwell's discomfort was obvious. He wanted to push her out of her comfort zone, show her the beauty in the struggle. But maybe he was being too selfish.

MISS CALDWELL: 
(raises an eyebrow) 
I have plenty of adventure in my life, thank you very much. I don't need to suffer through this heat for it.

V.O. (Miss Caldwell) Ugh, this heat is unbearable. Why did I agree to this journey? I should have stayed home with my books and tea. These men are so insufferable, I can't even think straight. I just want to be done with this and go back to my quiet life.

ALFRED: 
(smiling) 
But the charm of the outdoor life, the tingling of adventure. It's worth it, isn't it?

V.O. (Alfred) ```
The sun beat down mercilessly, but the charm of the outdoor life is too alluring to resist. I can see it in Miss Caldwell's face too - the thrill of adventure. I'm glad I joined this wagon-train. The journey may be tough, but it's worth it.

MISS CALDWELL: 
(rolls her eyes) 
To you, maybe. I just want a cool bath and some time to myself.

V.O. (Miss Caldwell) ```
Ugh, these men are so tiresome. I can feel the sweat dripping down my back and the sun is relentless. I just want to be alone for a moment, to wash off the dust and sweat and clear my mind. This journey is going to be a long one.

ALLEN: 
(laughs) 
Well, we can't have that. We need you to keep us entertained.

MISS CALDWELL: 
(teasingly) 
Oh, I'm sure you can find plenty of entertainment without me.

ALFRED: 
(serious) 
But Miss Caldwell, you must admit, there is something special about this journey. The vastness of the plains, the freedom of the open road.

V.O. (Alfred) ""Serious? This journey is nothing but a grueling trek through endless heat and dust. I can't understand how Miss Caldwell can see anything special about it. I just want it to end, to be back in the comfort of my own home.""

MISS CALDWELL: 
(smiling) 
I'll take your word for it, Alfred.

ALLEN: 
(leaning closer) 
But have you ever experienced the thrill of a plains storm? The thunder, the lightning, the wind whipping through your hair.

[SFX : THUNDER]

V.O. (Allen) ""Wow, Miss Caldwell is really struggling in this heat. But have you ever experienced the thrill of a plains storm? The thunder, the lightning, the wind whipping through your hair. It's exhilarating. I can't wait to see her reaction when we finally reach the cool, refreshing rain.""

MISS CALDWELL: 
(shudders) 
No thank you. I prefer to stay dry and comfortable.

ALFRED: 
(leaning in) 
But you must admit, Miss Caldwell, there is a certain beauty in the chaos of a storm.

V.O. (Alfred) ""She's right, of course. The chaos of a storm is beautiful, but only from a distance. Up close, it's terrifying. Just like this journey. The heat, the dust, the endless expanse. But I'll keep going, for her. She deserves a better life than this.""

MISS CALDWELL: 
(sighs) 
I suppose you're right. But I still prefer my comforts.

ALLEN: 
(whispers) 
You know, I heard a rumor that there's a hidden oasis somewhere along this journey. A place where we can all take a dip in a cool, refreshing pool.

MISS CALDWELL: 
(suddenly interested) 
Really? Where?

V.O. (Miss Caldwell) ""Where? Could it be a mirage? Or perhaps a sign of civilization in this desolate land? I must find out. This journey has been grueling, but the thought of a cool bath and solitude keeps me going. I just hope it's not too far.""

ALFRED: 
(smiling) 
Now, now, Allen. Don't get her hopes up. We have enough to worry about on this journey without chasing after mirages.

MISS CALDWELL: 
(disappointed) 
Oh well.

ALLEN: 
(winks) 
But who knows, maybe we'll get lucky.

V.O. (Allen) ALLEN: But who knows, maybe we'll get lucky. (winks) 
Inner monologue: I can't help but feel optimistic when Miss Caldwell is around. Her presence brings a sense of hope and relief to this grueling journey. Maybe she'll see me in a different light if I keep making her smile.

MISS CALDWELL: 
(smirks) 
I'll believe it when I see it.

V.O. (Miss Caldwell) ""Ugh, these men are so foolish. They think they can make it to the gold fields with their jokes and idle chatter. I'll believe it when I see it. But for now, I'll just have to endure this unbearable heat and keep my thoughts to myself.""

ALFRED: 
(chuckles) 
Well, if anyone can find it, it's you, Allen.

ALLEN: 
(grinning) 
Challenge accepted.

NARRATOR: 
The trio continued on their journey, the sun beating down on them and the wheels creaking beneath them. But despite the hardships, they found comfort and joy in each other's company. And who knows, maybe they would stumble upon that hidden oasis after all.

"The man whose story is here to be told was the wealthiest and most influential person in his parish; his name was Thord Overaas. He appeared in the priest's study one day, tall and earnest. ""I have gotten a son,"" said he, ""and I wish to present him for baptism.""  ""What shall his name be?""  ""Finn,â€”after my father.""  ""And the sponsors?""  They were mentioned, and proved to be the best men and women of Thord's relations in the parish.  ""Is there anything else?"" inquired the priest, and looked up.  The peasant hesitated a little.  ""I should like very much to have him baptized by himself,"" said he, finally.  ""That is to say on a week-day?""  ""Next Saturday, at twelve o'clock noon.""  ""Is there anything else?"" inquired the priest.  ""There is nothing else;"" and the peasant twirled his cap, as though he were about to go.  Then the priest rose. ""There is yet this, however,"" said he, and walking toward Thord, he took him by the hand and looked gravely into his eyes: ""God grant that the child may become a blessing to you!""  One day sixteen years later, Thord stood once more in the priest's study.  ""Really, you carry your age astonishingly well, Thord,"" said the priest; for he saw no change whatever in the man.  ""That is because I have no troubles,"" replied Thord.  To this the priest said nothing, but after a while he asked: ""What is your pleasure this evening?""  ""I have come this evening about that son of mine who is to be confirmed to-morrow.""  ""He is a bright boy.""  ""I did not wish to pay the priest until I heard what number the boy would have when he takes his place in church to-morrow.""  ""He will stand number one.'  ""So I have heard; and here are ten dollars for the priest.""  ""Is there anything else I can do for you?"" inquired the priest, fixing his eyes on Thord.  ""There is nothing else.""  Thord went out.  Eight years more rolled by, and then one day a noise was heard outside of the priest's study, for many men were approaching, and at their head was Thord, who entered first.  The priest looked up and recognized him.  ""You come well attended this evening, Thord,""  ""I am here to request that the banns may be published for my son; he is about to marry Karen Storliden, daughter of Gudmund, who stands here beside me.""  ""Why, that is the richest girl in the parish.""  ""So they say,"" replied the peasant, stroking back his hair with one hand.  The priest sat a while as if in deep thought, then entered the names in his book, without making any comments, and the men wrote their signatures underneath. ",drama,serious,"Thord Overaas, Thord's son, Priest, Karen Storliden, Gudmund","NARRATOR: 
The atmosphere is somber as THORD OVERAAS, the wealthiest and most influential man in the parish, enters the PRIEST'S STUDY, tall and serious. He has come to discuss his son's baptism, requesting that it be held on a week-day.

THORD OVERAAS: 
(twirling his cap) 
I have come to present my son, Finn, for baptism.

V.O. (Thord Overaas) Thord enters the priest's study, twirling his cap nervously. He can't believe it's been sixteen years since he first came here to present Finn for baptism. Now, he's back to discuss his son's confirmation and marriage. It's hard to believe how quickly time has passed. But Finn has grown into a fine young man, and Thord couldn't be prouder. He's grateful for the priest's guidance all these years, and he's happy to pay him with ease. He's a wealthy man, after all. But more importantly, he's a father who wants the best for his son. And now, as he watches Finn prepare to start his own family, Thord can't help but feel a sense of pride and joy. He knows that Finn will make a good husband and father, just like he has been. And as he leaves the priest's study, he can't help but feel grateful for the blessings that have been bestowed upon his family.

PRIEST: 
What shall his name be?

THORD OVERAAS: 
(after a moment's hesitation) 
Finn - after my father.

PRIEST: 
And the sponsors?

THORD OVERAAS: 
(mentioning the best men and women of his relations) 
They will be the best men and women of my relations in the parish.

V.O. (Thord Overaas) They will be the best men and women of my relations in the parish. What a proud moment this is, to see my son grow into a fine young man. I have provided for him and secured his future, just as I have always done. My legacy will live on through him.

PRIEST: 
Is there anything else?

THORD OVERAAS: 
(after a pause) 
I would like him to be baptized on a week-day.

PRIEST: 
(nods) 
Next Saturday, at twelve o'clock noon.

NARRATOR: 
The priest looks up and sees the hesitation in Thord's eyes.

PRIEST: 
(standing and taking Thord's hand) 
God grant that the child may become a blessing to you.

NARRATOR: 
Sixteen years later, Thord returns to the study to discuss his son's confirmation.

THORD OVERAAS: 
(after paying the priest) 
I have come this evening about my son's confirmation tomorrow.

PRIEST: 
(smiling) 
He is a bright boy.

THORD OVERAAS: 
(handling over money) 
I did not wish to pay the priest until I heard what number the boy would have when he takes his place in church tomorrow.

PRIEST: 
(looking down at the money) 
He will stand number one.

THORD OVERAAS: 
(nodding) 
So I have heard. Here are ten dollars for the priest.

PRIEST: 
Is there anything else I can do for you?

V.O. (Priest) Is there anything else I can do for you? No, my son. I have done what I can for your family, but I fear it may not be enough. I can see the weight of your wealth and power bearing down on you, and I pray that it does not consume you.

THORD OVERAAS: 
(after a moment's thought) 
There is nothing else.

V.O. (Thord Overaas) As Thord Overaas stands in the priest's study, surrounded by memories of his son's milestones, he can't help but feel a sense of emptiness. There is nothing else for him to request, no more celebrations to plan. After a moment's thought, he realizes that his son has grown up and no longer needs his guidance. It's a bittersweet feeling, but he knows he has done his best.

NARRATOR: 
Eight years later, Thord returns once more, this time with a group of men to request the banns for his son's marriage to the richest girl in the parish.

THORD OVERAAS: 
(leading the group into the study) 
I am here to request that the banns may be published for my son. He is about to marry Karen Storliden, daughter of Gudmund.

PRIEST: 
(surprised) 
Why, that is the richest girl in the parish.

THORD OVERAAS: 
(stroking back his hair) 
So they say.

PRIEST: 
(after a moment's thought) 
I will enter the names in my book.

V.O. (Priest) I can't believe how quickly time has passed. It feels like just yesterday I was blessing Thord's son at his baptism. Now he's getting married! It's amazing how much can change in just a few years. I hope I can continue to guide them both on their journey.

NARRATOR: 
The priest writes down the names, and the men sign their names underneath.

PRIEST: 
(looking up at Thord) 
Is there anything else?

THORD OVERAAS: 
(solemnly) 
There is nothing else.

V.O. (Thord Overaas) As Thord stands before the priest, he can't help but feel a sense of emptiness. The years have passed so quickly, and now he's back once again for another milestone in his son's life. But as he looks around the study, he realizes that there truly is nothing else. No one to share these moments with, no one to pass on his legacy. Just him, alone, in this somber atmosphere.

NARRATOR: 
Thord and his son's love story is one that has been admired by many, as they grew up together and have always been inseparable. Despite her family's wealth, Karen is humble and down-to-earth, and her love for Finn is genuine and pure.

NARRATOR: 
And so, the banns are published, and the wedding takes place, uniting two of the most influential families in the parish.

NARRATOR: 
The priest watches as Karen and Finn exchange their vows, and he can't help but think about the blessings that Thord's son has brought to his family and community.

PRIEST: 
(whispering to Thord) 
God has truly blessed you and your family, Thord.

THORD OVERAAS: 
(nodding) 
Indeed, He has.

NARRATOR: 
As the ceremony ends, the priest looks out at the happy faces of the newlyweds and the proud parents.

PRIEST: 
(smiling) 
May your marriage be as strong and enduring as your love for each other.

NARRATOR: 
And with that, the priest blesses the newlyweds, knowing that Thord's son has truly become a blessing to his family and the parish.

German soldiers could be seen along the roads, on the edges of fields, standing in front of gates or chatting outside cafes. They covered the soil like African locusts.  The officer said, with a wave of his hand:  ""If I had been in command, I'd have taken Paris, burned everything, killed everybody. No more France!""  The Englishman, through politeness, replied simply:  ""Ah! yes.""  He went on:  ""In twenty years all Europe, all of it, will belong to us. Prussia is more than a match for all of them.""  The Englishmen, getting uneasy, no longer replied. Their faces, which had become impassive, seemed made of wax behind their long whiskers. Then the Prussian officer began to laugh. And still, lolling back, he began to sneer. He sneered at the downfall of France, insulted the prostrate enemy; he sneered at Austria, which had been recently conquered; he sneered at the valiant but fruitless defence of the departments; he sneered at the Garde Mobile and at the useless artillery.

Outside, the landscape was filled with signs of war - hamlets occupied by the victorious army, German soldiers scattered along the roads and fields, and the remnants of burned down buildings. The officer's words were like a threat, his laughter like a warning. And when the train stopped at a burned down station, the tension reached its peak. M.

"One glance over the crumbling wall at the edge was generally sufficient for a visitor of even the strongest nerves. There was a sheer drop of more than a mile straight down, and at the distant bottom were jagged rocks and stunted trees that looked, in the blue haze, like shrubbery.  ""This is the spot,"" said the man to himself, ""and to-morrow morning is the time.""  John Bodman had planned his crime as grimly and relentlessly, and as coolly, as ever he had concocted a deal on the Stock Exchange. There was no thought in his mind of mercy for his unconscious victim. His hatred had carried him far.  The next morning after breakfast, he said to his wife: ""I intend to take a walk in the mountains. Do you wish to come with me?""  ""Yes,"" she answered briefly.  ""Very well, then,"" he said; ""I shall be ready at nine o'clock.""  ""I shall be ready at nine o'clock,"" she repeated after him.  At that hour they left the hotel together, to which he was shortly to return alone. They spoke no word to each other on their way to the Hanging Outlook. The path was practically level, skirting the mountains, for the Hanging Outlook was not much higher above the sea than the hotel.  John Bodman had formed no fixed plan for his procedure when the place was reached. He resolved to be guided by circumstances. Now and then a strange fear arose in his mind that she might cling to him and possibly drag him over the precipice with her. He found himself wondering whether she had any premonition of her fate, and one of his reasons for not speaking was the fear that a tremor in his voice might possibly arouse her suspicions. He resolved that his action should be sharp and sudden, that she might have no chance either to help herself or to drag him with her. Of her screams in that desolate region he had no fear. No one could reach the spot except from the hotel, and no one that morning had left the house, even for an expedition to the glacier--one of the easiest and most popular trips from the place.  Curiously enough, when they came within sight of the Hanging Outlook, Mrs. Bodman stopped and shuddered. Bodman looked at her through the narrow slits of his veiled eyes, and wondered again if she had any suspicion. No one can tell, when two people walk closely together, what unconscious communication one mind may have with another.  ",drama,suspenseful,"John Bodman, Mrs. Bodman","NARRATOR:

His wife's betrayal had filled him with an intense hatred, and he couldn't wait to make her suffer. The fear of her taking him down with her only fueled his determination. This would be her final destination.

We only knew that we were stopped by high water in front and rear, and that Miggles was our rock of refuge.

Evidently Miggles's, and evidently Miggles did not keep a hotel.  The driver got down and tried the gate. It was securely locked. Miggles! O Miggles!""  No answer.  ""Migg-ells! You Miggles!"" continued the driver, with rising wrath.  ""Migglesy!"" joined the expressman, persuasively. ""O Miggy! Mig!""  But no reply came from the apparently insensate Miggles. The Judge, who had finally got the window down, put his head out and propounded a series of questions, which if answered categorically would have undoubtedly elucidated the whole mystery, but which the driver evaded by replying that ""if we didn't want to sit in the coach all night, we had better rise up and sing out for Miggles.""  So we rose up and called on Miggles in chorus; then separately. And when we had finished, a Hibernian fellow-passenger from the roof called for ""Maygells!"" whereat we all laughed. While we were laughing, the driver cried ""Shoo!""  We listened. To our infinite amazement the chorus of ""Miggles"" was repeated from the other side of the wall, even to the final and supplemental ""Maygells.""  ""Extraordinary echo,"" said the Judge.  ""Extraordinary damned skunk!"" roared the driver, contemptuously. ""Come out of that, Miggles, and show yourself! Be a man, Miggles! Don't hide in the dark; I wouldn't if I were you, Miggles,"" continued Yuba Bill, now dancing about in an excess of fury.  ""Miggles!"" continued the voice. ""O Miggles!""  ""My good man! Mr. Myghail!"" said the Judge, softening the asperities of the name as much as possible. ""Consider the inhospitality of refusing shelter from the inclemency of the weather to helpless females. Really, my dear sir--"" But a succession of ""Miggles,"" ending in a burst of laughter, drowned his voice.  Yuba Bill hesitated no longer.",mystery,mysterious,"Miggles, The Judge, Washoe traveler, Yuba Bill, Expressman","NARRATOR: 
The travelers approached Miggles's wall, the air thick with mystery. The stone wall loomed before them, eight feet high and foreboding.

YUBA BILL: 
(angrily) 
Come on, Miggles! Open up this damn gate!

THE JUDGE: 
(calmly) 
Perhaps we should try reasoning with him.

WASHOE TRAVELER: 
(curious) 
Who is this Miggles, anyway?

V.O. (Washoe Traveler) Who is this Miggles, anyway? I can feel it in my bones, this is no ordinary place. The air is thick with mystery and the stone wall looms before us. I can't help but wonder what secrets lie beyond. But the Judge's attempts are met with only laughter. What kind of man hides in the shadows like this?

EXPRESSMAN: 
(smirking) 
A man of many names and many talents.

V.O. (Expressman) ""Ha! A man of many names and many talents, they say. More like a man of many disguises and many secrets. But who am I to judge? After all, I'm just an EXPRESSMAN, delivering packages and letters to all sorts of mysterious places. Speaking of mysteries, what's with this Miggles character? I can feel the tension in the air, and it's not just from the travelers. Something's not right here.""

The driver tried the locked gate to no avail, calling out for Miggles in frustration.

YUBA BILL: 
(shouting)

NARRATOR: 
The Judge's attempts to reason with the unseen host were met only with laughter and echoes.

THE JUDGE: 
(politely) 
My dear sir, we are in need of shelter from the storm. Would you kindly let us in?

V.O. (The Judge) The Judge's mind raced as he tried to make sense of the situation. Was Miggles truly a kind host, or a dangerous stranger? He couldn't help but feel a sense of unease in the darkness, surrounded by the unknown. But for the sake of his companions, he had to remain calm and polite.

As the travelers waited in the darkness, they were enveloped by the sights and sounds of the night - the moon casting eerie shadows, the rustling of leaves, and the distant howling of a lone wolf.

EXPRESSMAN: 
(teasingly) 
Perhaps it's Miggles, playing tricks on us.

NARRATOR: 
All the while, the mysterious Miggles remained hidden, his intentions unknown.

YUBA BILL: 
(determined) 
We can't just sit here all night. We need to find another way in.

V.O. (Yuba Bill) ""Come on, Yuba Bill, you can't give up now. There has to be another way in. Keep your head up and your eyes open. We didn't come all this way just to turn around. We'll find a way to get inside and uncover Miggles's secrets, no matter what it takes.""

Please, Miggles. We are stranded and in need of your help.

Why won't this Miggles help us? We're stranded and at his mercy. I can feel the tension rising in the group, and I fear we may not make it through the night. I must stay calm and think of a way out of this predicament.

But as the storm raged on, it became clear that Miggles was not just a name, but a symbol of resilience and survival in the face of adversity.

"Corley's stride acknowledged the compliment. The swing of his burly body made his friend execute a few light skips from the path to the roadway and back again. Corley was the son of an inspector of police and he had inherited his father's frame and gut. He walked with his hands by his sides, holding himself erect and swaying his head from side to side. His head was large, globular and oily; it sweated in all weathers; and his large round hat, set upon it sideways, looked like a bulb which had grown out of another. He always stared straight before him as if he were on parade and, when he wished to gaze after someone in the street, it was necessary for him to move his body from the hips. At present he was about town. Whenever any job was vacant a friend was always ready to give him the hard word. He was often to be seen walking with policemen in plain clothes, talking earnestly. He knew the inner side of all affairs and was fond of delivering final judgments. He spoke without listening to the speech of his companions. His conversation was mainly about himself what he had said to such a person and what such a person had said to him and what he had said to settle the matter. When he reported these dialogues he aspirated the first letter of his name after the manner of Florentines.  Lenehan offered his friend a cigarette. As the two young men walked on through the crowd Corley occasionally turned to smile at some of the passing girls but Lenehan's gaze was fixed on the large faint moon circled with a double halo. He watched earnestly the passing of the grey web of twilight across its face. At length he said:  ""Well... tell me, Corley, I suppose you'll be able to pull it off all right, eh?""  Corley closed one eye expressively as an answer.  ""Is she game for that?"" asked Lenehan dubiously. ""You can never know women.""  ""She's all right,"" said Corley. ""I know the way to get around her, man. She's a bit gone on me.""  ""You're what I call a gay Lothario,"" said Lenehan. ""And the proper kind of a Lothario, too!""  A shade of mockery relieved the servility of his manner. To save himself he had the habit of leaving his flattery open to the interpretation of raillery. But Corley had not a subtle mind.  ""There's nothing to touch a good slavey,"" he affirmed. ""Take my tip for it."" ",fiction,serious,"Corley, Lenehan, Harpist","NARRATOR: 
As Corley and Lenehan walked down the busy city street, their conversation was serious and hushed. Corley's large frame and confident stride caught the attention of passersby, while Lenehan's eyes were fixed on the moon, its faint glow surrounded by a double halo.

CORLEY: 
(smiling at passing girls) 
So, Lenehan, what do you think of her?

LENEHAN: 
(doubtful) 
I don't know, Corley. She seems a bit out of your league.

V.O. (Lenehan) I don't know, Corley. She seems a bit out of your league. But then again, you always did have a way with women. Maybe I'm just jealous. But I can't deny that there's something off about this whole situation. I hope you know what you're doing.

CORLEY: 
(confidently) 
There's nothing I can't handle. I know the way to get around her.

LENEHAN: 
(rolling his eyes) 
You always think you have all the answers, don't you?

V.O. (Lenehan) Ugh, Corley is so full of himself. Always thinking he's got it all figured out. But I know better. I can see right through his smooth talk and charm. He may think he's a master manipulator, but I'm not buying it. I just hope he doesn't drag me down with him.

CORLEY: 
(smugly) 
I've never had a problem with the ladies. They can't resist my charm.

LENEHAN: 
(teasing) 
You're quite the ladies' man, aren't you?

V.O. (Lenehan) Lenehan watched Corley's confident stride and charming smile, feeling envious and annoyed. He couldn't understand how Corley effortlessly attracted women, while he struggled to even make eye contact. But he couldn't let Corley see his jealousy. ""Yeah, he's a real ladies' man,"" Lenehan thought sarcastically, rolling his eyes.

CORLEY: 
(flashing a cocky grin) 
You could say that.

NARRATOR: 
Corley's head was large and oily, his round hat perched sideways. He walked with his hands by his sides, swaying his head from side to side. He always stared straight ahead, as if on parade.

LENEHAN: 
(eyeing Corley's hat) 
Is that hat a new addition to your wardrobe?

V.O. (Lenehan) Lenehan couldn't help but feel a twinge of envy as he eyed Corley's new hat. He always seemed to have the latest fashion, while Lenehan struggled to make ends meet. But he pushed his emotions aside, determined to focus on their conversation. He couldn't let Corley's smooth talk distract him from their plans.

CORLEY: 
(proudly) 
It's the latest style. Makes me stand out, don't you think?

NARRATOR: 
Lenehan couldn't help but roll his eyes at Corley's vanity.

LENEHAN: 
(sarcastically) 
Yes, you're quite the trendsetter.

CORLEY: 
(smiling) 
I like to make an impression.

NARRATOR: 
As they continued their walk, Corley occasionally flashed a smile at passing girls, but his focus was on their conversation.

CORLEY: 
(earnestly) 
I know the way to get around her, Lenehan. She's a bit gone on me.

LENEHAN: 
(doubtful) 
You can never know women.

V.O. (Lenehan) ```
Lenehan's doubt grew as he walked alongside Corley. ""You can never know women,"" he thought, his mind filled with uncertainty. He couldn't help but feel skeptical about Corley's plans, knowing his true intentions. Women were a mystery, and Lenehan couldn't shake the feeling that they were about to get themselves into trouble.

CORLEY: 
(confidently) 
Trust me, I've got this.

NARRATOR: 
Lenehan couldn't help but shake his head. He knew Corley's true intentions, but he also knew there was no changing his mind.

LENEHAN: 
(teasing) 
You're what I call a gay Lothario.

CORLEY: 
(proudly) 
And the proper kind of a Lothario, too!

V.O. (Corley) ```
Proudly, I strut down the street, basking in the attention of those around me. Lenehan's doubt is laughable, I know I can win her over. And why not? I am a proper Lothario, after all. With my charm and confidence, she'll be mine in no time.

NARRATOR: 
A shade of mockery relieved the servility of Lenehan's manner. To save himself, he had the habit of leaving his flattery open to interpretation.

LENEHAN: 
(smiling) 
But seriously, Corley, do you really think she'll go for it?

CORLEY: 
(confidently) 
She's all right. I know the way to get around her, man. She's a bit gone on me.

LENEHAN: 
(teasing) 
You're quite the charmer, aren't you?

CORLEY: 
(smiling) 
I've never had a problem with the ladies. They can't resist me.

NARRATOR: 
As they continued their walk, Lenehan couldn't help but shake his head at Corley's arrogance. But he also couldn't deny that Corley had a certain charm that seemed to work on women.

LENEHAN: 
(smiling) 
Well, I guess we'll see what happens.

V.O. (Lenehan) Well, I guess we'll see what happens. I can't help but smile at Corley's confidence, even though I know his true intentions. But maybe he's right, there's nothing like a good slavey. As long as I don't get caught up in his schemes, I'll be fine.

CORLEY: 
(earnestly) 
Trust me, Lenehan. I've got this under control.

NARRATOR: 
As they strolled, Lenehan's gaze was fixed on the moon, its faint glow surrounded by a double halo. He watched earnestly as the grey web of twilight passed over its face.

LENEHAN: 
(lost in thought) 
It's beautiful, isn't it?

CORLEY: 
(smiling) 
Yes, but not as beautiful as the lady we're discussing.

LENEHAN: 
(teasing) 
You're hopeless, Corley.

CORLEY: 
(smiling) 
But you love me anyway.

NARRATOR: 
Lenehan couldn't help but laugh as they continued their walk, their conversation turning to other topics. But in the back of his mind, he couldn't help but wonder how Corley's plan would play out. Only time would tell.

But it is the Spanish olive that you eat,"" explained the head waiter, a German ""from Basel."" ""These are for oil only."" After which he disliked the olive more than ever--until that night when he saw the first eatable specimen rolling across the shiny parquet floor, propelled towards him by the careless hand of a pretty girl, who then looked up into his eyes and smiled.  He was convinced that Eve, similarly, had rolled the apple towards Adam across the emerald sward of the first garden in the world.  He slept usually like the dead. It must have been something very real that made him open his eyes and sit up in bed alertly. There was a noise against his door. He listened. The room was still quite dark. It was early morning. The noise was not repeated.  ""Who's there?"" he asked in a sleepy whisper. ""What is it?""  The noise came again. Some one was scratching on the door. No, it was somebody tapping.  ""What do you want?"" he demanded in a louder voice. ""Come in,"" he added, wondering sleepily whether he was presentable. Either the hotel was on fire or the porter was waking the wrong person for some sunrise expedition.  Nothing happened. Wide awake now, he turned the switch on, but no light flooded the room. The electricians, he remembered with a curse, were out on strike. He fumbled for the matches, and as he did so a voice in the corridor became distinctly audible. It was just outside his door.  ""Aren't you ready?"" he heard. ""You sleep for ever.""  And the voice, although never having heard it before, he could not have recognised it, belonged, he knew suddenly, to the girl who had let the olive fall. In an instant he was out of bed. He lit a candle.  ""I'm coming,"" he called softly, as he slipped rapidly into some clothes. ""I'm sorry I've kept you. I shan't be a minute.""  ""Be quick then!"" he heard, while the candle flame slowly grew, and he found his garments. Less than three minutes later he opened the door and, candle in hand, peered into the dark passage.

Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in the details of Mr. Jabez Wilson's appearance as they sat in the serious atmosphere of Holmes' office. The smell of snuff lingered in the air as Wilson shifted in his chair, his eyes shifting between Holmes and his questioning glances. The sound of Holmes' voice filled the room as he began to list off the details he had deduced about Wilson, from his manual labor to his Freemasonry and recent travels to China. The sight of Wilson's tattooed wrist and the shiny cuff of his shirt added to the mystery, and the weight of the situation hung heavily in the room as Holmes began to piece together the puzzle.

""I cannot see that there is anything very funny,"" cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. ""If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.""  ""No, no,"" cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. ""I really wouldn't miss your case for the world. It is most refreshingly unusual.

""'What, the red-headed man?' ""'Yes.' ""'Oh,' said he, 'his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.' ""'Where could I find him?' ""'Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul's.' ""I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross."" ""And what did you do then?"" asked Holmes. ""I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you."" ""And you did very wisely,"" said Holmes. ""Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear."" ""Grave enough!"" said Mr. Jabez Wilson. ""Why, I have lost four pound a week.""",mystery,humorous ,"Sherlock Holmes, Doctor (narrator), Mr. Jabez Wilson","NARRATOR: 
The atmosphere in Sherlock Holmes's office was tense as the red-faced Mr. Jabez Wilson recounted his peculiar case. As he spoke, the smell of old books and tobacco lingered in the air, adding to the cozy yet mysterious setting.

SHERLOCK HOLMES: 
(intently listening) 
Please continue, Mr. Wilson.

DOCTOR: 
(sympathetically) 
That must have been quite a shock.

SHERLOCK HOLMES: 
(calculating) 
And what about the other offices you visited?

DOCTOR: 
(puzzled) 
But why would anyone go to such lengths to create a fake organization?

SHERLOCK HOLMES: 
(smiling) 
Ah, that is the question, isn't it? Mr. Wilson, I believe this case is far from ordinary.

SHERLOCK HOLMES: 
(assuringly) 
Do not worry, Mr. Wilson. We will get to the bottom of this.

DOCTOR: 
(curious) 
What steps did you take after visiting the offices?

V.O. (Doctor) Curious, I asked about the doctor's steps after visiting the offices. The atmosphere was tense, but the smell of old books and tobacco added a cozy touch. Holmes and I couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity, but there was urgency beneath it all. I knew we had to solve this case.

SHERLOCK HOLMES: 
(leaning forward) 
And why did you come to me, Mr. Wilson?

DOCTOR: 
(optimistically) 
And you did the right thing. We will not rest until we have solved this mystery.

SHERLOCK HOLMES: 
(standing up) 
Let us waste no time then. We must visit the man's new office at once.

NARRATOR: 
The three men quickly made their way to the address given by Mr. Wilson. As they approached the building, the sun shone through the dusty windows, casting a warm glow on the scene.

SHERLOCK HOLMES: 
(observing) 
Interesting. A manufactory of artificial knee-caps, just like the other address.

DOCTOR: 
(perplexed) 
But why would a solicitor be using such a place as his office?

V.O. (Doctor) Perplexed, I couldn't help but wonder what kind of case this was. A solicitor using this place as his office? It didn't make sense. But then again, nothing about this case did. The laughter in the room only added to my confusion. Holmes promised to solve it, but I couldn't shake off this uneasy feeling.

SHERLOCK HOLMES: 
(smiling) 
That is what we are here to find out. Come, let us speak to the landlord.

NARRATOR: 
The landlord, a stout man with a friendly face, greeted them at the door.

LANDLORD: 
(politely) 
Good afternoon, gentlemen. How may I assist you?

SHERLOCK HOLMES: 
(suspiciously) 
We are looking for a Mr. William Morris. We were told he had an office here.

LANDLORD: 
(shaking his head) 
I am afraid I have never heard of such a person.

DOCTOR: 
(incredulously) 
But Mr. Wilson said he was using your room as a temporary convenience.

LANDLORD: 
(remembering) 
Ah, yes, the red-headed man. His name was William Morris, but he moved out yesterday.

V.O. (Landlord) What a strange man, this William Morris. I remember him well, with his fiery hair and quick temper. But now he's gone, and I'm left with another tenant to fill his place. Perhaps I should raise the rent, after all, it seems I have a reputation to uphold.

SHERLOCK HOLMES: 
(urgently) 
Where can we find him now?

V.O. (Sherlock Holmes) Where can we find him now? The urgency in their voice is palpable. This case must be more complex than I initially thought. But I can't let my emotions show. I must remain calm and focused, even in the midst of chaos. Time is of the essence, and I won't rest until I solve this puzzling mystery.

LANDLORD: 
(thinking) 
He mentioned something about new offices. Yes, I believe it was 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul's.

DOCTOR: 
(thankfully) 
Thank you, sir. You have been most helpful.

NARRATOR: 
The three men quickly made their way to the new address, their minds racing with possibilities. As they arrived at the building, a sense of urgency filled the air.

SHERLOCK HOLMES: 
(determined) 
We must find Mr. Morris and get to the bottom of this mystery.

DOCTOR: 
(optimistically) 
And we will, with your help, Mr. Holmes.

V.O. (Doctor) ""Finally, a case that will challenge my intellect. I can practically see the gears turning in Holmes's mind as he pieces together the clues. With our combined skills, we will surely crack this case and bring justice to Mr. Wilson. I can't wait to see the look of satisfaction on his face.""

With renewed determination, the three men entered the building, ready to unravel the truth behind the Red-headed League. The case may have started out as a comical affair, but the stakes were much higher than anyone could have imagined.

Granser sits in his cabin, surrounded by the young boys, telling them about the world before it all changed. His voice is gentle, but serious, as he explains the concept of numbers to them. He takes a grain of sand and equates it to ten fingers, then adds more and more grains until it represents one hundred. He uses pebbles and mussel-shells to represent even larger numbers, struggling to find enough symbols to convey the enormity of the population. The boys' eyes widen in wonder as they try to comprehend the four million people who once lived in San Francisco, and the seven million across the bay.

"We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes. ""You are not very vulnerable from above,"" Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him. ""Nor from below,"" said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. ""Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!"" he remarked, looking up in surprise. ""I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!"" said Holmes severely. ""You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?"" The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket. ""We have at least an hour before us,"" he remarked, ""for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor—as no doubt you have divined—in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present."" ""It is our French gold,"" whispered the director. ""We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it."" ""Your French gold?"" ""Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France.

The group had reached the same crowded thoroughfare from earlier, but this time the atmosphere was tense and eerie. Their cabs were dismissed and they followed Mr. Merryweather down a narrow passage and through a side door. Inside, the small corridor led to a massive iron gate, which opened to reveal winding stone steps that led to another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather lit a lantern and guided them down a dark, earth-smelling passage into a huge vault filled with crates and boxes. Holmes held up the lantern, noting the lack of vulnerability from above or below. The group's presence had already imperilled their mission, so Holmes instructed them to sit and be quiet. He examined the cracks between the stones with a magnifying lens, confirming they had an hour before the criminals would make a move. They were in the cellar of a London bank, where a large sum of French gold was being stored. The tension was palpable as the director whispered about previous warnings of an attempt to steal the gold. The group knew they had to act fast, before the criminals made their move.

I always have a plan, Mr. Merryweather.

V.O. (Sherlock Holmes) As I suspected, this is no ordinary heist. The criminals have planned for every eventuality. But so have I. I can feel the tension rising in the room, but I will not let it affect me. I will find a way to outsmart them, as I always do.

That is our bait. And we must make sure it is well-protected.

The group emerged onto the crowded thoroughfare once again, but this time they were on a mission. Holmes led them to a nearby building and they entered through a side door. Inside, they were met with a small corridor that ended in a very massive iron gate. Holmes quickly picked the lock and led them down a flight of winding stone steps. They soon arrived at another formidable gate, which Holmes also unlocked.

SHERLOCK HOLMES:

We must be quiet now. We do not want to alert our adversaries.

SHERLOCK HOLMES:

Trust me, Mr. Merryweather. I have my ways.

V.O. (Sherlock Holmes) As the group followed Mr. Merryweather down the dark, eerie passage, a smirk formed on my lips. I knew my ways would lead us to the criminals and their stolen gold. The tension in the air only fueled my excitement. Time was of the essence, and I was ready to make my move.

NARRATOR: 
Holmes led them down a dark, earth-smelling passage and finally, after opening a third door, they arrived at a huge vault or cellar. The walls were lined with crates and massive boxes, and in the center of the room stood a large safe. Holmes quickly set to work, setting traps and alarms around the room.

SHERLOCK HOLMES: 
(smiling) 
I observed the clues, my dear Watson. The French gold, the warnings, and the location of the bank. It all pointed to this cellar.

NARRATOR: 
As Holmes worked, Mr. Merryweather paced nervously and Dr. Watson watched in awe. Finally, Holmes stood up and dusted off his hands.

SHERLOCK HOLMES: 
(looking at his pocket watch) 
We must hurry. The pawnbroker will be in bed soon.

SHERLOCK HOLMES: 
(nodding) 
Yes. And we will be ready for them.

NARRATOR: 
The group waited in silence, the tension building with each passing minute. Finally, they heard the sound of footsteps coming down the passage. Mr. Merryweather gripped his cane tightly and Dr. Watson held his breath. Holmes, however, remained calm and collected as ever.

Welcome, gentlemen. We have been expecting you.

The criminals were caught off guard, but they quickly regained their composure and charged at the group. A fierce battle ensued, but in the end, Holmes and his companions emerged victorious. The criminals were apprehended and the French gold was safe once again.

"Hundreds of miles from CERN, a voice crackled through a walkie-talkie. “Okay, I’m in the hallway.” The technician monitoring the video screens pressed the button on his transmitter. “You’re looking for camera #86. It’s supposed to be at the far end.” There was a long silence on the radio. The waiting technician broke a light sweat. Finally his radio clicked. “The camera isn’t here,” the voice said. “I can see where it was mounted, though. Somebody must have removed it.” The technician exhaled heavily. “Thanks. Hold on a second, will you?” Sighing, he redirected his attention to the bank of video screens in front of him. Huge portions of the complex were open to the public, and wireless cameras had gone missing before, usually stolen by visiting pranksters looking for souvenirs. But as soon as a camera left the facility and was out of range, the signal was lost, and the screen went blank. Perplexed, the technician gazed up at the monitor. A crystal clear image was still coming from camera #86. If the camera was stolen, he wondered, why are we still getting a signal? He knew, of course, there was only one explanation. The camera was still inside the complex, and someone had simply moved it. But who? And why? He studied the monitor a long moment. Finally he picked up his walkietalkie. “Are there any closets in that stairwell? Any cupboards or dark alcoves?” The voice replying sounded confused. “No. Why?” The technician frowned. “Never mind. Thanks for your help.” He turned off his walkie-talkie and pursed his lips. Considering the small size of the video camera and the fact that it was wireless, the technician knew that camera #86 could be transmitting from just about anywhere within the heavily guarded compound—a densely packed collection of thirty-two separate buildings covering a half-mile radius. The only clue was that the camera seemed to have been placed somewhere dark. Of course, that wasn’t much help. The complex contained endless dark locations —maintenance closets, heating ducts, gardening sheds, bedroom wardrobes, even a labyrinth of underground tunnels. Camera #86 could take weeks to locate. But that’s the least of my problems, he thought. Despite the dilemma posed by the camera’s relocation, there was another far more unsettling matter at hand.

"Do I have your attention now?” the man’s voice said when Langdon finally answered the line. “Yes, sir, you damn well do. You want to explain yourself?” “I tried to tell you before.” The voice was rigid, mechanical. “I’m a physicist. I run a research facility. We’ve had a murder. You saw the body.” “How did you find me?” Langdon could barely focus. His mind was racing from the image on the fax. “I already told you. The Worldwide Web. The site for your book, The Art of the Illuminati.” Langdon tried to gather his thoughts. His book was virtually unknown in mainstream literary circles, but it had developed quite a following on-line. Nonetheless, the caller’s claim still made no sense. “That page has no contact information,” Langdon challenged. “I’m certain of it.” “I have people here at the lab very adept at extracting user information from the Web.” Langdon was skeptical. “Sounds like your lab knows a lot about the Web.” “We should,” the man fired back. “We invented it.” Something in the man’s voice told Langdon he was not joking. “I must see you,” the caller insisted. “This is not a matter we can discuss on the phone. My lab is only an hour’s flight from Boston.” Langdon stood in the dim light of his study and analyzed the fax in his hand. The image was overpowering, possibly representing the epigraphical find of the century, a decade of his research confirmed in a single symbol. “It’s urgent,” the voice pressured. Langdon’s eyes were locked on the brand. Illuminati, he read over and over. His work had always been based on the symbolic equivalent of fossils—ancient documents and historical hearsay—but this image before him was today. Present tense. He felt like a paleontologist coming face to face with a living dinosaur. “I’ve taken the liberty of sending a plane for you,” the voice said. “It will be in Boston in twenty minutes.” Langdon felt his mouth go dry. An hour’s flight . . . “Please forgive my presumption,” the voice said. “I need you here.” Langdon looked again at the fax—an ancient myth confirmed in black and white. The implications were frightening. He gazed absently through the bay window. The first hint of dawn was sifting through the birch trees in his backyard, but the view looked somehow different this morning. As an odd combination of fear and exhilaration settled over him, Langdon knew he had no choice. “You win,” he said. “Tell me where to meet the plane.”",mystery,suspenseful,"Langdon, The man on the phone","NARRATOR:

"Not many children could say they remembered the day they met their father, but Vittoria Vetra could. She was eight years old, living where she always had, Orfanotrofio di Siena, a Catholic orphanage near Florence, deserted by parents she never knew. It was raining that day. The nuns had called for her twice to come to dinner, but as always she pretended not to hear. She lay outside in the courtyard, staring up at the raindrops . . . feeling them hit her body . . . trying to guess where one would land next. The nuns called again, threatening that pneumonia might make an insufferably headstrong child a lot less curious about nature. I can’t hear you, Vittoria thought. She was soaked to the bone when the young priest came out to get her. She didn’t know him. He was new there. Vittoria waited for him to grab her and drag her back inside. But he didn’t. Instead, to her wonder, he lay down beside her, soaking his robes in a puddle. “They say you ask a lot of questions,” the young man said. Vittoria scowled. “Are questions bad?” He laughed. “Guess they were right.” “What are you doing out here?” “Same thing you’re doing . . . wondering why raindrops fall.” “I’m not wondering why they fall! I already know!” The priest gave her an astonished look. “You do?” “Sister Francisca says raindrops are angels’ tears coming down to wash away our sins.” “Wow!” he said, sounding amazed. “So that explains it.” “No it doesn’t!” the girl fired back. “Raindrops fall because everything falls! Everything falls! Not just rain!” The priest scratched his head, looking perplexed. “You know, young lady, you’re right. Everything does fall. It must be gravity.” “It must be what?” He gave her an astonished look. “You haven’t heard of gravity?” “No.” The priest shrugged sadly. “Too bad. Gravity answers a lot of questions.” Vittoria sat up. “What’s gravity?” she demanded. “Tell me!” The priest gave her a wink. “What do you say I tell you over dinner.” The young priest was Leonardo Vetra. Although he had been an awardwinning physics student while in university, he’d heard another call and gone into the seminary. Leonardo and Vittoria became unlikely best friends in the lonely world of nuns and regulations. Vittoria made Leonardo laugh, and he took her under his wing, teaching her that beautiful things like rainbows and the rivers had many explanations. He told her about light, planets, stars, and all of nature through the eyes of both God and science. Vittoria’s innate intellect and curiosity made her a captivating student. Leonardo protected her like a daughter.",drama,optimistic,"Vittoria Vetra, Father Leonardo Vetra, Sister Francisca","NARRATOR: 
Vittoria was an eight-year-old girl living in Orfanotrofio di Siena, a Catholic orphanage near Florence. She was abandoned by her parents and had no memory of them. Despite being surrounded by nuns and strict rules, Vittoria was a curious and headstrong child. She loved to spend her time outside, observing and questioning everything around her. One day, she met a young priest named Leonardo Vetra, who became her best friend and mentor. Leonardo's passion for science and his unique perspective on the world opened Vittoria's mind to a whole new way of thinking. He taught her about gravity, light, and the wonders of nature, and in return, Vittoria's innate intellect and curiosity made her a captivating student. Leonardo became a father figure to Vittoria, and she looked up to him with admiration and love. Together, they explored the mysteries of the universe, and Vittoria's thirst for knowledge only grew stronger with each passing day.

VITTORIA: 
(staring up at the raindrops) 
(feeling them hit her body)

NARRATOR: 
It was raining that day, and Vittoria lay outside in the courtyard, mesmerized by the falling rain. The nuns had called for her twice to come to dinner, but as always she pretended not to hear. She was lost in her thoughts, wondering about the mysteries of nature.

NUN: 
(calling out) 
Vittoria, come inside for dinner!

VITTORIA: 
(ignoring the call) 
I can't hear you.

NUN: 
(calling out again) 
Vittoria, come inside before you catch a cold!

NARRATOR: 
But Vittoria was determined to stay outside and continue her observations. That's when a young priest, Father Leonardo Vetra, came out to get her.

FATHER VETRA: 
(lying down beside her) 
(feeling the rain soak his robes)

NARRATOR: 
To Vittoria's surprise, he didn't scold her or drag her back inside. Instead, he joined her in the puddle and asked her about her questions.

FATHER VETRA: 
(laughing) 
They say you ask a lot of questions.

V.O. (Father Vetra) ""Ha! They're right, I do ask a lot of questions. But how can I not, when I have this brilliant, curious little girl by my side? She's my light in this dark world, and I'll do whatever it takes to protect her. Thank God for bringing us together in that rain-soaked courtyard.""

VITTORIA: 
(scowling) 
Are questions bad?

V.O. (Vittoria) Are questions bad? Of course not! I don't understand why the nuns always tell me to stop asking so many questions. Leonardo never scowls at me when I ask him something new. He says that's how we learn and grow. I wish he could be my father forever.

FATHER VETRA: 
(guessing) 
(trying to lighten the mood)

V.O. (Father Vetra) (trying to lighten the mood)
Father Vetra's heart aches as he remembers the day he met Vittoria. She was so small, so alone. But her bright eyes and curious mind gave him hope. He'll do anything to protect her. And maybe, just maybe, she can save him too.

VITTORIA: 
(serious) 
What are you doing out here?

FATHER VETRA: 
(smiling) 
Same thing you're doing...wondering why raindrops fall.

VITTORIA: 
(disagreeing) 
I'm not wondering why they fall! I already know!

FATHER VETRA: 
(amazed) 
You do?

VITTORIA: 
(confidently) 
Sister Francisca says raindrops are angels' tears coming down to wash away our sins.

V.O. (Vittoria) Raindrops are angels' tears? That's silly. Maybe Sister Francisca just wants us to feel guilty. But Leonardo says God and science can coexist. I believe him. He's the only one who understands me. I wish he could be my real father.

FATHER VETRA: 
(amused) 
Wow! So that explains it.

V.O. (Father Vetra) Wow! So that explains it. I never would have guessed that the little girl I met in the rain all those years ago would turn out to be my daughter. It's amazing how life works. She's grown into such a bright and curious young woman. I couldn't be prouder.

VITTORIA: 
(correcting him) 
No, it doesn't! Raindrops fall because everything falls! Everything falls! Not just rain!

FATHER VETRA: 
(scratching his head) 
(perplexed)

VITTORIA: 
(curious) 
What must be what?

FATHER VETRA: 
(amazed) 
You haven't heard of gravity?

VITTORIA: 
(shaking her head) 
No.

FATHER VETRA: 
(sadly) 
Too bad. Gravity answers a lot of questions.

NARRATOR: 
Vittoria sat up, intrigued by this new concept.

VITTORIA: 
(determined) 
What's gravity? Tell me!

FATHER VETRA: 
(winking) 
What do you say I tell you over dinner?

V.O. (Father Vetra) Dinner with Vittoria's father? I can't believe it. She's grown up so fast. I remember when she was just a little girl, full of curiosity and wonder. Now, she's a brilliant young woman. I'm so proud of her. I can't wait to hear all about her life.

NARRATOR: 
And that's how Vittoria and Father Vetra's friendship began. He was an award-winning physics student who had heard another calling and gone into the seminary. Despite their different backgrounds, they bonded over their love for science and nature.

FATHER VETRA: 
(sitting down for dinner) 
So, Vittoria, what do you want to know about gravity?

VITTORIA: 
(excited) 
Everything!

NARRATOR: 
And so, Father Vetra began to explain the wonders of gravity to Vittoria, and she soaked up every bit of knowledge like a sponge. From that day on, they became unlikely best friends in the lonely world of nuns and regulations. Vittoria's innate intellect and curiosity made her a captivating student, and Father Vetra was proud to be her mentor.

FATHER VETRA: 
(teaching) 
Gravity is the force that pulls objects towards each other. It's what keeps us grounded on Earth and what makes the planets orbit around the sun.

VITTORIA: 
(listening intently) 
(amazed)

NARRATOR: 
And so, Vittoria's thirst for knowledge only grew stronger, and Father Vetra was proud to be a part of her journey. In the midst of a strict and lonely environment, Vittoria found hope and optimism in the form of her new friend.

FATHER VETRA: 
(looking at Vittoria with love) 
You are a brilliant and curious young girl, Vittoria. Never stop asking questions and seeking answers.

V.O. (Father Vetra) Father Vetra looked at Vittoria with love, remembering the day they met. He couldn't believe how much she had grown, both physically and intellectually. She was a brilliant and curious young girl, and he was so proud of her. He hoped she would never stop asking questions and seeking answers, for that was what made her truly special.

NARRATOR: 
And Vittoria never did. Thanks to Father Vetra's guidance and Sister Francisca's love, she grew into a brilliant and compassionate young woman, always looking at the world through the eyes of both God and science.

It was the first time he had seen her, she realized, smiling to herself in pleasure. She stood up, coming toward him shyly. ""Go on,"" she said. ""I'm waiting.""  The cuckoo opened his bill.

Despite their differences, Doris and Larry's love for each other and the cuckoo clock remained strong. They continued their routine, with Doris winding the clock and Larry carefully covering the little door with his thumb.

DORIS: 
(whispering to the clock) 
Do you hear me? I think you're the most wonderful cuckoo in the world.

V.O. (Doris) ""Do you hear me? I think you're the most wonderful cuckoo in the world. Oh, how I've longed for you to finally see me. I've tried so hard to make sure you're happy, but Larry always has to interfere. Maybe he's just jealous of our special connection.

LARRY: 
(smiling) 
I hope you'll like it here.

NARRATOR: 
One day, Doris forgot to wind the clock and the cuckoo stopped coming out. Larry, who had grown quite fond of the bird, couldn't bear to see it dormant.

LARRY: 
(sighing) 
I'll take care of it.

NARRATOR: 
He went into the dining room, where the clock was mounted on the wall over the fireplace. He carefully took the clock down and made sure to cover the little door with his thumb before winding it up.

DORIS: 
(walking in) 
Why do you put your thumb over the door?

LARRY: 
(serious) 
You're supposed to.

V.O. (Larry) ""Damn that cuckoo clock. Can't believe I have to deal with this again. Always forgetting to wind it up. But Doris loves it, so I'll just have to suck it up and do it. Maybe one day I'll actually get along with that bird. Who knows, maybe it'll grow on me.""

DORIS: 
(raising an eyebrow) 
Are you sure? Or are you just afraid of the cuckoo?

LARRY: 
(grinning) 
Maybe a little bit.

NARRATOR: 
Doris and Larry's playful banter continued, but their love for each other and the cuckoo clock only grew stronger. They knew that no matter what, they would always be there to take care of each other and their beloved clock.

DORIS: 
(whispering to the clock) 
You're perfect, just like I hoped.

LARRY: 
(smiling) 
And you're the most wonderful cuckoo keeper in the world.

NARRATOR: 
As the clock chimed, Doris and Larry shared a loving look, knowing that they were meant to be together, just like the cuckoo and its clock.

The dimly lit military command center was filled with the constant hum of machines and the occasional beep of a radar. Kramer and Gross sat deep in conversation, their faces etched with worry and determination. The air was thick with tension as they discussed their latest obstacle - a pseudopodium, a living weapon that had proven to be a formidable opponent.

You can see the situation. How can we deal with a factor like this? The perfect variable.

It's a perfect defense, for them. But there still might be one answer.

V.O. (Kramer) Kramer's mind raced as he considered their latest theory. The pseudopodium was unlike anything they had ever encountered, and their current strategies were proving futile. But he couldn't give up - there had to be a way to defeat it. He just needed to find the answer before it was too late.

GROSS: 
What's that?

KRAMER: 
Wait a minute.

KRAMER: 
The heavy cruiser that returned this week. It didn't actually touch, did it? It came close but there was no contact.

ROCKET EXPERT: 
Correct. The mine was twenty miles off. The cruiser was in space-drive, moving directly toward Proxima, line-straight, using the Johnson Control, of course. It had deflected a quarter of an hour earlier for reasons unknown. Later it resumed its course. That was when they got it.

Here's our theory. We keep looking for contact, a trigger in the pseudopodium. But more likely we're witnessing a psychological phenomena, a decision without any physical correlative. We're watching for something that isn't there. The mine decides to blow up. It sees our ship, approaches, and then decides.

NARRATOR: 
Kramer and Gross continued to discuss their theories and ideas, their minds racing with possibilities. The rocket expert's role became even more crucial, as they analyzed and strategized, trying to find a way to break through the enemy's impenetrable defense. In the midst of a heated discussion, the rocket expert provided valuable insights that often led to breakthroughs.

ROCKET EXPERT: 
We may not be able to defeat their living minefield with our current technology, but we have another advantage.

GROSS: 
What's that?

ROCKET EXPERT: 
Our own advanced intelligence. We can outthink them, anticipate their movements, and find a weakness in their defenses.

KRAMER: 
That's it! We'll use their own tactics against them. We'll create a living weapon of our own, one that can outsmart and outmaneuver the enemy.

GROSS: 
But how?

KRAMER: 
We'll start by analyzing their behavior and decision-making processes. We'll use our knowledge of psychology and our advanced technology to create a weapon that can infiltrate their defenses and destroy them from within.

"One day Murlock returned from gunning in a distant part of the forest to find his wife prostrate with fever, and delirious. There was no physician within miles, no neighbor; nor was she in a condition to be left, to summon help. So he set about the task of nursing her back to health, but at the end of the third day she fell into unconsciousness arid so passed away, apparently, with never a gleam of returning reason.  From what we know of a nature like his we may venture to sketch in some of the details of the outline picture drawn by my grandfather. When convinced that she was dead, Murlock had sense enough to remember that the dead must be prepared for burial. In performance of this sacred duty he blundered now and again, did certain things incorrectly, and others which he did correctly were done over and over. His occasional failures to accomplish some simple and ordinary act filled him with astonishment, like that of a drunken man who wonders at the suspension of familiar natural laws. He was surprised, too, that he did not weep--surprised and a little ashamed; surely it is unkind not to weep for the dead. ""Tomorrow,"" he said aloud, ""I shall have to make the coffin arid dig the grave; and then I shall miss her, when she is no longer in sight; but now--she is dead, of course, but it is all right--it must be all right, somehow. Things cannot be so bad as they seem.""  He stood over the body in the fading light, adjusting the hair and putting the finishing touches to the simple toilet, doing all mechanically, with soulless care. And still through his consciousness ran an undersense of conviction that all was right--that he should have her again as before, and everything explained. He had had no experience in grief; his capacity had not been enlarged by use. His heart could not contain it all, nor his imagination rightly conceive it. He did not know he was so hard struck; that knowledge would come later, and never go. Grief is an artist of powers as various as the instruments upon which he plays his dirges for the dead, evoking from some the sharpest, shrillest notes, from others the low, grave chords that throb recurrent like the slow beating of a distant drum.

"Every Sunday he met in this very spot Monsieur Sauvage, a stout, jolly, little man, a draper in the Rue Notre Dame de Lorette, and also an ardent fisherman. They often spent half the day side by side, rod in hand and feet dangling over the water, and a warm friendship had sprung up between the two.  Some days they did not speak; at other times they chatted; but they understood each other perfectly without the aid of words, having similar tastes and feelings.  In the spring, about ten o'clock in the morning, when the early sun caused a light mist to float on the water and gently warmed the backs of the two enthusiastic anglers, Morissot would occasionally remark to his neighbor:  ""My, but it's pleasant here.""  To which the other would reply:  ""I can't imagine anything better!""  And these few words sufficed to make them understand and appreciate each other.  In the autumn, toward the close of day, when the setting sun shed a blood-red glow over the western sky, and the reflection of the crimson clouds tinged the whole river with red, brought a glow to the faces of the two friends, and gilded the trees, whose leaves were already turning at the first chill touch of winter, Monsieur Sauvage would sometimes smile at Morissot, and say:  ""What a glorious spectacle!""  And Morissot would answer, without taking his eyes from his float:  ""This is much better than the boulevard, isn't it?""  As soon as they recognized each other they shook hands cordially, affected at the thought of meeting under such changed circumstances.  Monsieur Sauvage, with a sigh, murmured:  ""These are sad times!""  Morissot shook his head mournfully.  ""And such weather! This is the first fine day of the year.""

"She tried to speak to the little quadroon boy; but no sound would come, at first. When he heard his name uttered, he looked up, and his mistress was pointing to the door. He laid aside the great, soft fan, and obediently stole away, over the polished floor, on his bare tiptoes. She stayed motionless, with gaze riveted upon her child, and her face the picture of fright. Presently her husband entered the room, and without noticing her, went to a table and began to search among some papers which covered it. ""Armand,"" she called to him, in a voice which must have stabbed him, if he was human. But he did not notice. ""Armand,"" she said again. Then she rose and tottered towards him. ""Armand,"" she panted once more, clutching his arm, ""look at our child. What does it mean? Tell me."" He coldly but gently loosened her fingers from about his arm and thrust the hand away from him. ""Tell me what it means!"" she cried despairingly. ""It means,"" he answered lightly, ""that the child is not white; it means that you are not white."" A quick conception of all that this accusation meant for her nerved her with unwonted courage to deny it. ""It is a lie; it is not true, I am white! Look at my hair, it is brown; and my eyes are gray, Armand, you know they are gray. And my skin is fair,"" seizing his wrist. ""Look at my hand; whiter than yours, Armand,"" she laughed hysterically.

I cannot be so unhappy, and live."" The answer that came was brief: ""My own Desiree: Come home to Valmonde; back to your mother who loves you. Come with your child.""

""When my men come to release us you will wish, perhaps, that you were in a better plight than caught poaching on a neighbour's land, shame on you.""  Georg was silent for a moment; then he answered quietly:  ""Are you sure that your men will find much to release? I have men, too, in the forest to-night, close behind me, and _they_ will be here first and do the releasing. When they drag me out from under these damned branches it won't need much clumsiness on their part to roll this mass of trunk right over on the top of you. Your men will find you dead under a fallen beech tree. For form's sake I shall send my condolences to your family.""  ""It is a useful hint,"" said Ulrich fiercely. ""My men had orders to follow in ten minutes time, seven of which must have gone by already, and when they get me out--I will remember the hint. Only as you will have met your death poaching on my lands I don't think I can decently send any message of condolence to your family.""  ""Good,"" snarled Georg, ""good. We fight this quarrel out to the death, you and I and our foresters, with no cursed interlopers to come between us. Death and damnation to you, Ulrich von Gradwitz.""  ""The same to you, Georg Znaeym, forest-thief, game-snatcher.""  Both men spoke with the bitterness of possible defeat before them, for each knew that it might be long before his men would seek him out or find him; it was a bare matter of chance which party would arrive first on the scene.",drama,mysterious,"Ulrich von Gradwitz, Georg Znaeym","NARRATOR: 
The forest was cloaked in darkness, the only light coming from the moon peeking through the leaves. All around them lay a thick-strewn wreckage of splintered branches and broken twigs. The air was thick with the smell of pine and damp earth. Relief at being alive mixed with exasperation at his captive plight, bringing a strange medley of pious thank-offerings and sharp curses to Ulrich's lips. The sound of rustling leaves and snapping twigs filled the air as the two men struggled against each other. Both knew that it might be long before their men would seek them out, their fate hanging in the balance like a leaf on the wind.

[SFX : RUSTLING LEAVES]

ULRICH VON GRADWITZ: 
(angrily) 
Damn you, Georg Znaeym! You think you can just waltz onto my land and take what doesn't belong to you? You're a thief and a poacher, and you'll pay for your crimes.

GEORG ZNAEYM: 
(smirking) 
Well, well, well. Look who's talking, Ulrich von Gradwitz. The self-righteous lord of the manor, always so quick to judge others. But I see you're not so high and mighty now, are you? Caught in your own trap.

ULRICH VON GRADWITZ: 
(gritting his teeth) 
I'll have you know that this is my land, and I have every right to protect it. You're the one who's trespassing.

GEORG ZNAEYM: 
(rolling his eyes) 
Oh, spare me the lecture. I know all about your precious family history and your supposed rights. But let me tell you something, Ulrich. The only thing that matters out here in the forest is strength. And right now, I'm the stronger one.

V.O. (Georg Znaeym) ""Ugh, here we go again. Ulrich always spouting off about his precious family and their so-called rights. But in the end, it's just about who's stronger. And right now, that's me. I'll make sure he knows it too, even if it means dragging his sorry butt through this godforsaken forest all night.""

ULRICH VON GRADWITZ: 
(furiously) 
You may have the upper hand for now, but my men will come for me. And when they do, you'll be the one begging for mercy.

V.O. (Ulrich Von Gradwitz) Ulrich's blood boiled with fury as he stared at his captor. He was trapped in this godforsaken forest, his men nowhere in sight. He could feel the frustration building within him, a mix of relief at being alive and anger at his helpless state. But he refused to show weakness, knowing that his men would come for him. And when they did, he would make this man pay for his arrogance.

GEORG ZNAEYM: 
(laughing) 
Oh, I'm shaking in my boots. Your men won't find you, Ulrich. My men are already on their way, and they won't be as merciful as I am.

ULRICH VON GRADWITZ: 
(scornfully) 
Merciful? You call this mercy? You've blinded me with your poaching and left me to die under this fallen tree. That's not mercy, Georg. That's pure evil.

V.O. (Ulrich Von Gradwitz) ""Merciful? Ha! More like a coward, hiding behind your title. You've always been jealous of my land and now you've stooped to this. But I won't let you win. I'll survive and when our men find us, I'll make sure they know the truth. You won't get away with this, Georg.""

GEORG ZNAEYM: 
(grinning) 
Evil? You have no idea what true evil is, Ulrich. You and your family have been terrorizing us for generations. It's about time someone fought back.

V.O. (Georg Znaeym) The adrenaline rushed through Georg's veins as he watched Ulrich struggle against him. He couldn't help but grin at the thought of finally standing up to the man who had caused so much pain and suffering. But as he looked around at the destruction they had caused, a twinge of guilt and regret crept in. Was this really the right thing to do? But it was too late to turn back now. They were both at the mercy of the forest, and only time would tell who would come out on top.

ULRICH VON GRADWITZ: 
(voice dripping with contempt) 
You're nothing but a coward, Georg. Attacking me from behind like a common criminal. You have no honor, no dignity.

GEORG ZNAEYM: 
(voice rising with anger) 
I have more honor in my little finger than you have in your entire body, Ulrich. And I'll prove it by taking back what's rightfully mine.

ULRICH VON GRADWITZ: 
(shouting) 
You'll never take anything from me, Georg. Not my land, not my pride, and certainly not my life.

V.O. (Ulrich Von Gradwitz) ""Damn Georg and his stubbornness. I won't give in, not even in the face of death. The forest is my home, my pride, my life. I'll fight until my last breath, even if it means cursing and thanking the gods simultaneously. This struggle may be long, but I'll never surrender.""

GEORG ZNAEYM: 
(smiling wickedly) 
We'll see about that, won't we? But for now, let's enjoy the silence. It won't be long before our men arrive, and then the real battle will begin.

V.O. (Georg Znaeym) ""Ha, this fool thinks he has the upper hand. Little does he know, I have a plan. This silence is just the calm before the storm. My men will come, and we will emerge victorious. The forest may be dark, but my mind is ablaze with strategy and determination. Let the battle begin.""

ULRICH VON GRADWITZ: 
(voice filled with determination) 
I'll fight you to the death, Georg. I won't let you win.

V.O. (Ulrich Von Gradwitz) ""I won't let you take what's rightfully mine, Georg. Not after all these years. I'll fight until my last breath, even if it means death. The forest may be dark, but my determination shines brighter. I refuse to lose to you. I refuse to lose everything.""

GEORG ZNAEYM: 
(voice filled with equal determination) 
I wouldn't have it any other way, Ulrich. May the best man win.

NARRATOR: 
The two men glared at each other, their hatred and rivalry burning like a fire in the darkness. Both knew that this was a battle that would not end until one of them was victorious. And as they waited for their men to arrive, the forest was filled with an eerie silence, as if it was holding its breath, waiting to see who would emerge as the ultimate victor.

"From the lamppost something was hanging. A shapeless dark bundle, swinging a little with the wind. Like a dummy of some sort. Loyce rolled down his window and peered out. What the hell was it? A display of some kind? Sometimes the Chamber of Commerce put up displays in the square.  Again he made a U-turn and brought his car around. He passed the park and concentrated on the dark bundle. It wasn't a dummy. And if it was a display it was a strange kind. The hackles on his neck rose and he swallowed uneasily. Sweat slid out on his face and hands.  It was a body. A human body.  ""Look at it!"" Loyce snapped. ""Come on out here!""  Don Fergusson came slowly out of the store, buttoning his pin-stripe coat with dignity. ""This is a big deal, Ed. I can't just leave the guy standing there.""  ""See it?"" Ed pointed into the gathering gloom. The lamppost jutted up against the skyâ€”the post and the bundle swinging from it. ""There it is. How the hell long has it been there?"" His voice rose excitedly. ""What's wrong with everybody? They just walk on past!""  Don Fergusson lit a cigarette slowly. ""Take it easy, old man. There must be a good reason, or it wouldn't be there.""  ""A reason! What kind of a reason?""  Fergusson shrugged. ""Like the time the Traffic Safety Council put that wrecked Buick there. Some sort of civic thing. How would I know?""  Jack Potter from the shoe shop joined them. ""What's up, boys?""  ""There's a body hanging from the lamppost,"" Loyce said.

The town square was shrouded in darkness, the only source of light coming from the lone lamppost. From it, something swung in the wind, a shapeless bundle that seemed to defy explanation. Loyce's curiosity piqued, he rolled down his window and peered out. Was it a display? But as he made a U-turn and approached the park, he knew it was something else entirely. His heart raced as he realized it was a body, hanging lifelessly from the post.

LOYCE: 
(rolling down his window) 
What the hell is that?

V.O. (Loyce) What the hell is that? Loyce wondered, his heart pounding in his chest. He couldn't believe his eyes - a body hanging from the lone lamppost in the town square. How could everyone just walk by without a second glance? Loyce's curiosity was piqued, his mind racing with questions as he approached the body. Who was this man? What had happened to him? Loyce couldn't wait to unravel the mystery.

DON FERGUSSON: 
(lighting a cigarette) 
Take it easy, old man. There must be a good reason, or it wouldn't be there.

LOYCE: 
(pointing at the body) 
A reason? What kind of reason?

DON FERGUSSON: 
(shrugging) 
Like the time the Traffic Safety Council put that wrecked Buick there. Some sort of civic thing. How would I know?

JACK POTTER: 
(approaching) 
What's up, boys?

V.O. (Jack Potter) What's up, boys? Why are they acting so nonchalant? Don't they see the body? Why isn't anyone doing anything? This town is crazy. I need to figure out who this guy is. Is it murder? Suicide? I have to get to the bottom of this.

LOYCE: 
(shocked) 
There's a body hanging from the lamppost. I'm going to call the cops.

V.O. (Loyce) Oh my god, a body? Should I call the cops? Wait, why isn't anyone else reacting? Don seems so calm. Maybe it's a prank. No, it's definitely real. Who is he? What happened to him? I need to find out.

JACK POTTER: 
(looking at his watch) 
They must know about it, or otherwise it wouldn't be there.

DON FERGUSSON: 
(headed back into the store) 
I got to get back in. Business before pleasure.

V.O. (Don Fergusson) Don Fergusson's mind raced as he headed back into the store. Business before pleasure, always. But as he passed by the town square, he couldn't help but be curious about the shapeless bundle hanging from the lone lamppost. Was it a display? No, it couldn't be. His heart sank as he realized it was a body. But even as Loyce called out to him, he couldn't shake the feeling of indifference. It was just another day in this mad world.

NARRATOR: 
Loyce began to get hysterical as he realized that no one else seemed to care about the body hanging in plain sight. He stepped onto the green and approached the body, his senses on high alert.

LOYCE: 
(whispering) 
You see it? You see it hanging there? A man's body! A dead man!

JACK POTTER: 
(calmly) 
Sure, Ed. I saw it this afternoon when I went out for coffee.

The man had been middle-aged. His clothing was ripped and torn, a gray suit, splashed and caked with dried mud. A stranger. Loyce had never seen him before. Not a local man.

LOYCE: 
(whispering) 
Who is he? Why is he here?

NARRATOR: 
Loyce's mind raced with questions as he tried to make sense of the situation. But as the minutes passed, no one else seemed to notice or care. The shock and fear of this strange and unsettling situation began to take its toll on Loyce, causing him to question everything he thought he knew about his quiet town.

NARRATOR: 
From that day on, Loyce couldn't shake the image of the unknown man's body, and it haunted him for days to come. This experience changed Loyce, making him more aware of the world around him and the people in it. He learned that sometimes, even in the most ordinary of places, there can be something dark and unsettling lurking just beneath the surface.

"Calixta, at home, felt no uneasiness for their safety. She sat at a side window sewing furiously on a sewing machine. She was greatly occupied and did not notice the approaching storm. But she felt very warm and often stopped to mop her face on which the perspiration gathered in beads. She unfastened her white sacque at the throat. It began to grow dark, and suddenly realizing the situation she got up hurriedly and went about closing windows and doors.  Out on the small front gallery she had hung Bobint's Sunday clothes to dry and she hastened out to gather them before the rain fell. As she stepped outside, Alce Laballire rode in at the gate. She had not seen him very often since her marriage, and never alone. She stood there with Bobint's coat in her hands, and the big rain drops began to fall. Alce rode his horse under the shelter of a side projection where the chickens had huddled and there were plows and a harrow piled up in the corner.  ""May I come and wait on your gallery till the storm is over, Calixta?"" he asked.  Come 'long in, M'sieur Alce.""  His voice and her own startled her as if from a trance, and she seized Bobint's vest. Alce, mounting to the porch, grabbed the trousers and snatched Bibi's braided jacket that was about to be carried away by a sudden gust of wind. He expressed an intention to remain outside, but it was soon apparent that he might as well have been out in the open: the water beat in upon the boards in driving sheets, and he went inside, closing the door after him. It was even necessary to put something beneath the door to keep the water out.  ""My! what a rain! It's good two years sence it rain' like that,"" exclaimed Calixta as she rolled up a piece of bagging and Alce helped her to thrust it beneath the crack.  She was a little fuller of figure than five years before when she married; but she had lost nothing of her vivacity. Her blue eyes still retained their melting quality; and her yellow hair, dishevelled by the wind and rain, kinked more stubbornly than ever about her ears and temples.  The rain beat upon the low, shingled roof with a force and clatter that threatened to break an entrance and deluge them there. They were in the dining room the sitting room the general utility room. Adjoining was her bed room, with Bibi's couch along side her own. The door stood open, and the room with its white, monumental bed, its closed shutters, looked dim and mysterious.  Alce flung himself into a rocker and Calixta nervously began to gather up from the floor the lengths of a cotton sheet which she had been sewing.",romance,Romantic,"Calixta, Bobint, Alce Laballire, Bibi","NARRATOR:

I can't help but think about what could have been if I had married her instead. But for now, let me just focus on helping her with these clothes.""

(thankful) 
Thank you, Alce. I don't know what I would do without you.

V.O. (Calixta) Thank you, Alce. I don't know what I would do without you. I'm so grateful for your help in this storm, but I can't help feeling a little guilty for being alone with you. It's been so long since we've been together, and now we're trapped in this house. What will happen?

NARRATOR: 
The rain beat down on the shingled roof, threatening to break in, as they sought refuge in the dimly lit rooms of her house. Alce helped Calixta keep the water out, and as they sat in the dining room, the romantic tension between them grew stronger.

ALCE: 
(leans in closer) 
You know, Calixta, I've always admired your determination and resourcefulness.

V.O. (Alce) ""What am I doing? This is wrong. But she's so beautiful, so full of life. I can't help but feel drawn to her. I've always admired her, but now, seeing her like this, I can't resist leaning in closer. This storm may be dangerous, but it's also bringing us together.""

CALIXTA: 
(blushes) 
Oh, stop it. You're making me blush.

NARRATOR: 
As the storm raged on, the two found themselves lost in conversation, sharing stories and laughter. They were so engrossed in each other's company that they didn't even notice the storm passing.

CALIXTA: 
(smiling) 
I can't believe it's already over. I had such a wonderful time with you, Alce.

ALCE: 
(grinning) 
I did too, Calixta. I hope we can do this again soon.

NARRATOR: 
As they said their goodbyes, the sun began to peek through the clouds, casting a warm light on the two of them. As Alce rode off into the distance, Calixta couldn't help but feel a flutter in her heart.

CALIXTA: 
(to herself) 
Maybe there's more to life than just being a wife and mother. Maybe I can have a little excitement too.

V.O. (Calixta) Maybe I've been too focused on being a wife and mother. But with this storm and Alce here, I can feel something stirring inside me. Is this what I've been missing? The thrill of adventure and the possibility of something more? I can't deny this feeling any longer.

And with that, Calixta went back inside, her heart full of newfound possibilities. The storm may have passed, but a new chapter in her life was just beginning.

"She did not stop to ask if it were or were not a monstrous joy that held her. A clear and exalted perception enabled her to dismiss the suggestion as trivial. She knew that she would weep again when she saw the kind, tender hands folded in death; the face that had never looked save with love upon her, fixed and gray and dead. But she saw beyond that bitter moment a long procession of years to come that would belong to her absolutely. And she opened and spread her arms out to them in welcome.  There would be no one to live for during those coming years; she would live for herself. There would be no powerful will bending hers in that blind persistence with which men and women believe they have a right to impose a private will upon a fellow-creature. A kind intention or a cruel intention made the act seem no less a crime as she looked upon it in that brief moment of illumination.  And yet she had loved him--sometimes. Often she had not. What did it matter! What could love, the unsolved mystery, count for in the face of this possession of self-assertion which she suddenly recognized as the strongest impulse of her being!  ""Free!

I beg; open the door--you will make yourself ill. What are you doing, Louise? For heaven's sake open the door.""  ""Go away. I am not making myself ill."" No; she was drinking in a very elixir of life through that open window.  Her fancy was running riot along those days ahead of her. Spring days, and summer days, and all sorts of days that would be her own. She breathed a quick prayer that life might be long. It was only yesterday she had thought with a shudder that life might be long.  She arose at length and opened the door to her sister's importunities. There was a feverish triumph in her eyes, and she carried herself unwittingly like a goddess of Victory. She clasped her sister's waist, and together they descended the stairs. Richards stood waiting for them at the bottom.  Someone was opening the front door with a latchkey. It was Brently Mallard who entered, a little travel-stained, composedly carrying his grip-sack and umbrella. He had been far from the scene of the accident, and did not even know there had been one. He stood amazed at Josephine's piercing cry; at Richards' quick motion to screen him from the view of his wife.  When the doctors came they said she had died of heart disease--of the joy that kills.",drama,Serious,"Louise, Josephine, Brently Mallard, Richards","NARRATOR:

"One evening while Farquhar and his wife were sitting on a rustic bench near the entrance to his grounds, a gray-clad soldier rode up to the gate and asked for a drink of water. Mrs. Farquhar was only too happy to serve him with her own white hands. While she was fetching the water her husband approached the dusty horseman and inquired eagerly for news from the front.  ""The Yanks are repairing the railroads,"" said the man, ""and are getting ready for another advance. They have reached the Owl Creek bridge, put it in order and built a stockade on the north bank. The commandant has issued an order, which is posted everywhere, declaring that any civilian caught interfering with the railroad, its bridges, tunnels or trains will be summarily hanged. I saw the order.""  ""How far is it to the Owl Creek bridge?"" Farquhar asked.  ""About thirty miles.""  ""Is there no force on this side the creek?""  ""Only a picket post half a mile out, on the railroad, and a single sentinel at this end of the bridge.""  ""Suppose a man--a civilian and student of hanging--should elude the picket post and perhaps get the better of the sentinel,"" said Farquhar, smiling, ""what could he accomplish?""  The soldier reflected. ""I was there a month ago,"" he replied. ""I observed that the flood of last winter had lodged a great quantity of driftwood against the wooden pier at this end of the bridge. It is now dry and would burn like tow.""  The lady had now brought the water, which the soldier drank. He thanked her ceremoniously, bowed to her husband and rode away.

But as the soldier speaks of their ruthless orders, Farquhar's mind races with a daring plan. The tension in the air is palpable, but so is his determination to protect his home.

NARRATOR: 
Farquhar's wife hurries off to get the water, leaving Farquhar and the gray-clad soldier alone.

FARQUHAR: 
(curiously) 
So, what news do you bring from the front?

FARQUHAR: 
(interested) 
And what about the civilians?

FARQUHAR: 
(smirking) 
Well, I happen to be a student of hanging. What if someone were to outsmart the picket post and the sentinel?

NARRATOR: 
Farquhar's mind begins to race with possibilities. He envisions a daring plan to burn the bridge and disrupt the enemy's advance.

FARQUHAR: 
(excitedly) 
Thank you for the information, soldier. You have been most helpful.

NARRATOR: 
The soldier bows and rides off into the night, leaving Farquhar and his wife alone once again.

FARQUHAR: 
(confidently) 
I have a plan to stop the Yanks. But I must go alone.

FARQUHAR: 
(assuringly) 
Don't worry, my dear. I'll be back before you know it.

NARRATOR: 
As night falls, Farquhar sneaks out of the plantation and heads towards the Owl Creek bridge. He must evade the picket post and the sentinel if he wants to succeed.

FARQUHAR: 
(whispering to himself) 
I can do this. I have to do this.

V.O. (Farquhar) ""I can do this. I have to do this. I won't let them take everything I've worked for. But what if I fail? What if they catch me? No, I must stay strong. I'll do whatever it takes to protect my family and my home. I'll burn that bridge if I have to.""

NARRATOR: 
Farquhar's heart races as he approaches the bridge. He can see the driftwood piled up against the wooden pier, just as the soldier had described.

FARQUHAR: 
(excitedly) 
I did it!

NARRATOR: 
But just as he is about to light the fire, he is caught by the sentinel.

SENTINEL: 
(raising his gun) 
Halt! Identify yourself!

NARRATOR: 
Farquhar's heart sinks as he realizes his plan has failed. He is captured and taken to the enemy's camp.

FARQUHAR: 
(defeated) 
I should have listened to my wife.

NARRATOR: 
Farquhar is summarily hanged, just as the soldier had warned. His daring plan to protect his home and family has ultimately led to his downfall.

NARRATOR: 
The plantation is left in a state of unease, unsure of what the future holds. The only sound is the distant chirping of crickets, a reminder of the peaceful life that was lost in the chaos of war.

"""Do you think, Colonel, that your brave Coulter would like to put one of his guns in here?"" the general asked.  He was apparently not altogether serious; it certainly did not seem a place where any artillerist, however brave, would like to put a gun. The colonel thought that possibly his division commander meant good-humoredly to intimate that in a recent conversation between them Captain Coulter's courage had been too highly extolled.  ""General,"" he replied warmly, ""Coulter would like to put a gun anywhere within reach of those people,"" with a motion of his hand in the direction of the enemy.  ""It is the only place,"" said the general. He was serious, then.  The place was a depression, a ""notch,"" in the sharp crest of a hill. It was a pass, and through it ran a turnpike, which reaching this highest point in its course by a sinuous ascent through a thin forest made a similar, though less steep, descent toward the enemy. For a mile to the left and a mile to the right, the ridge, though occupied by Federal infantry lying close behind the sharp crest and appearing as if held in place by atmospheric pressure, was inaccessible to artillery. There was no place but the bottom of the notch, and that was barely wide enough for the roadbed. From the Confederate side this point was commanded by two batteries posted on a slightly lower elevation beyond a creek, and a half-mile away. All the guns but one were masked by the trees of an orchard; that one--it seemed a bit of impudence--was on an open lawn directly in front of a rather grandiose building, the planter's dwelling. The gun was safe enough in its exposure--but only because the Federal infantry had been forbidden to fire. Coulter's Notch--it came to be called so--was not, that pleasant summer afternoon, a place where one would ""like to put a gun.""  Three or four dead horses lay there sprawling in the road, three or four dead men in a trim row at one side of it, and a little back, down the hill. All but one were cavalrymen belonging to the Federal advance. One was a quartermaster. The general commanding the division and the colonel commanding the brigade, with their staffs and escorts, had ridden into the notch to have a look at the enemy's guns--which had straightway obscured themselves in towering clouds of smoke. It was hardly profitable to be curious about guns which had the trick of the cuttle-fish, and the season of observation had been brief.",fiction,Serious,"Colonel, General, Captain Coulter","NARRATOR: 
The afternoon sun beat down on Coulter's Notch, a depression in the sharp crest of a hill. The air was thick with the smell of gunpowder and the sound of distant gunfire. The general and colonel stood at the bottom of the notch, surveying the enemy's position. Dead horses and men lay scattered on the road, a grim reminder of the violence that had taken place.

COLONEL: 
Do you think, General, that your brave Coulter would like to put one of his guns in here?

GENERAL: 
(serious) 
He was apparently not altogether serious; it certainly did not seem like a place where any artillerist, however brave, would like to put a gun.

V.O. (General) I can't believe the colonel is talking about bravery. This is a massacre. Those men and horses didn't stand a chance. I can't let my emotions show, I have to stay serious. But this is not a place for any brave soldier to be standing.

COLONEL: 
(slightly defensive) 
Perhaps you mean to suggest that in our last conversation, I may have exaggerated Captain Coulter's courage?

GENERAL: 
(warmly) 
No, Colonel. Coulter would like to put a gun anywhere within reach of those people.

Colonel, what do you make of the enemy's position?

V.O. (General) The afternoon sun beat down on Coulter's Notch, a depression in the sharp crest of a hill. The air was thick with the smell of gunpowder and the sound of distant gunfire.

General's inner monologue:

From a distance, I can see the enemy's position clearly. This is a dangerous game of cat and mouse, but I won't let them outsmart us. The colonel may speak of their bravery, but I know the true cost of this battle. We must tread carefully.

COLONEL:

It's a tough one, General. The Confederates have the high ground and we're sitting ducks down here.

Jimmy took the pardon in a tired kind of way. He had served nearly ten months of a four year sentence. He had expected to stay only about three months, at the longest.

V.O. (Jimmy) ""Thanks, Mike. It means a lot."" Jimmy's heart swelled with gratitude, but as he sat in silence, his mind raced with doubts. Would he be able to survive on the outside? The warden's warning echoed in his mind, reminding him of the dangers that awaited him. But he was free. For now.

MIKE DOLAN: 
(nods) 
Listen, Jimmy. I know you're innocent. I'll help you clear your name.

V.O. (Mike Dolan) Mike Dolan's mind raced as he watched Jimmy receive his pardon. He knew he had to help clear his friend's name, but the warden's words of caution lingered in his mind. He couldn't let Jimmy face the dangers of the outside world alone. He had to do something.

"Jerton had not harboured the least intention of extending his thirst for name-labels to his neighbour. After her rather remarkable announcement, however, he was obliged to say something in the way of polite inquiry.  ""Yes,"" answered the lady, ""I suppose it is a case of partial loss of memory. I was in the train coming down here; my ticket told me that I had come from Victoria and was bound for this place. I had a couple of five-pound notes and a sovereign on me, no visiting cards or any other means of identification, and no idea as to who I am. I can only hazily recollect that I have a title; I am Lady Somebody - beyond that my mind is a blank.""  ""Hadn't you any luggage with you?"" asked Jerton.  ""That is what I didn't know. I knew the name of this hotel and made up my mind to come here, and when the hotel porter who meets the trains asked if I had any luggage I had to invent a dressing-bag and dress-basket; I could always pretend that they had gone astray. I gave him the name of Smith, and presently he emerged from a confused pile of luggage and passengers with a dressing- bag and dress-basket labelled Kestrel-Smith. I had to take them; I don't see what else I could have done.""  Jerton said nothing, but he rather wondered what the lawful owner of the baggage would do.  ""Of course it was dreadful arriving at a strange hotel with the name of Kestrel-Smith, but it would have been worse to have arrived without luggage. Anyhow, I hate causing trouble.""  Jerton had visions of harassed railway officials and distraught Kestrel-Smiths, but he made no attempt to clothe his mental picture in words. The lady continued her story.  ""Naturally, none of my keys would fit the things, but I told an intelligent page boy that I had lost my key-ring, and he had the locks forced in a twinkling. Rather too intelligent, that boy; he will probably end in Dartmoor. The Kestrel-Smith toilet tools aren't up to much, but they are better than nothing.""  ""If you feel sure that you have a title,"" said Jerton, "" why not get hold of a peerage and go right through it?""  ""I tried that. I skimmed through the list of the House of Lords in 'Whitaker,' but a mere printed string of names conveys awfully little to one, you know.

Jerton stands awkwardly in the hotel lobby, unsure of how to proceed. He never expected his mundane morning to take such a bizarre turn. The woman in front of him, Lady Somebody, claims to have lost her memory and her identity. She recounts her story with a mix of confusion and amusement, while Jerton can't help but imagine the chaos that must have ensued in her wake. He can practically smell the sweat of the railway officials and hear the clanging of the locks as the page boy forces them open. As Lady Somebody continues her tale, Jerton can't help but feel a sense of dread at the thought of the poor Kestrel-Smiths who will surely be searching for their missing luggage.

"""There is a wild beast in your woods,"" said the artist Cunningham, as he was being driven to the station. It was the only remark he had made during the drive, but as Van Cheele had talked incessantly his companion's silence had not been noticeable.  ""A stray fox or two and some resident weasels. Nothing more formidable,"" said Van Cheele. The artist said nothing.  ""What did you mean about a wild beast?"" said Van Cheele later, when they were on the platform.  ""Nothing. My imagination. Here is the train,"" said Cunningham.  That afternoon Van Cheele went for one of his frequent rambles through his woodland property. He had a stuffed bittern in his study, and knew the names of quite a number of wild flowers, so his aunt had possibly some justification in describing him as a great naturalist. At any rate, he was a great walker. It was his custom to take mental notes of everything he saw during his walks, not so much for the purpose of assisting contemporary science as to provide topics for conversation afterwards. When the bluebells began to show themselves in flower he made a point of informing every one of the fact; the season of the year might have warned his hearers of the likelihood of such an occurrence, but at least they felt that he was being absolutely frank with them.  What Van Cheele saw on this particular afternoon was, however, something far removed from his ordinary range of experience. On a shelf of smooth stone overhanging a deep pool in the hollow of an oak coppice a boy of about sixteen lay asprawl, drying his wet brown limbs luxuriously in the sun. His wet hair, parted by a recent dive, lay close to his head, and his light-brown eyes, so light that there was an almost tigerish gleam in them, were turned towards Van Cheele with a certain lazy watchfulness. It was an unexpected apparition, and Van Cheele found himself engaged in the novel process of thinking before he spoke. Where on earth could this wild-looking boy hail from? The miller's wife had lost a child some two months ago, supposed to have been swept away by the mill-race, but that had been a mere baby, not a half-grown lad.  ""What are you doing there?"" he demanded.  ",mystery,suspenseful,"Van Cheele, Artist Cunningham, Wild boy","NARRATOR: 
The sun shone brightly through the lush green canopy of the woodland property, casting dappled shadows on the forest floor. A gentle breeze rustled through the leaves, carrying with it the sweet scent of wildflowers. Van Cheele's footsteps echoed softly as he walked, his mind preoccupied with thoughts of the mysterious boy he had encountered earlier. His heart raced with anticipation and unease as he approached the deep pool, where the boy lay sprawled on a smooth stone shelf. His light-brown eyes gleamed with a feral intensity, and Van Cheele couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to this boy than met the eye. What secrets did he hold, hidden within the depths of the woods?

VAN CHEELE:

I live in the woods. Where else would I be from?

There was a child that went missing recently, near the mill. Could you be that child?

"Langdon strode silently behind Vittoria and Kohler as they moved back into the main atrium where Langdon’s bizarre visit had begun. Vittoria’s legs drove in fluid efficiency—like an Olympic diver—a potency, Langdon figured, no doubt born from the flexibility and control of yoga. He could hear her breathing slowly and deliberately, as if somehow trying to filter her grief. Langdon wanted to say something to her, offer his sympathy. He too had once felt the abrupt hollowness of unexpectedly losing a parent. He remembered the funeral mostly, rainy and gray. Two days after his twelfth birthday. The house was filled with gray-suited men from the office, men who squeezed his hand too hard when they shook it. They were all mumbling words like cardiac and stress. His mother joked through teary eyes that she’d always been able to follow the stock market simply by holding her husband’s hand . . . his pulse her own private ticker tape. Once, when his father was alive, Langdon had heard his mom begging his father to “stop and smell the roses.” That year, Langdon bought his father a tiny blown glass rose for Christmas. It was the most beautiful thing Langdon had ever seen . . . the way the sun caught it, throwing a rainbow of colors on the wall. “It’s lovely,” his father had said when he opened it, kissing Robert on the forehead. “Let’s find a safe spot for it.” Then his father had carefully placed the rose on a high dusty shelf in the darkest corner of the living room. A few days later, Langdon got a stool, retrieved the rose, and took it back to the store. His father never noticed it was gone. The ping of an elevator pulled Langdon back to the present. Vittoria and Kohler were in front of him, boarding the lift. Langdon hesitated outside the open doors. “Is something wrong?” Kohler asked, sounding more impatient than concerned. “Not at all,” Langdon said, forcing himself toward the cramped carriage. He only used elevators when absolutely necessary. He preferred the more open spaces of stairwells. “Dr. Vetra’s lab is subterranean,” Kohler said. Wonderful, Langdon thought as he stepped across the cleft, feeling an icy wind churn up from the depths of the shaft. The doors closed, and the car began to descend. “Six stories,” Kohler said blankly, like an analytical engine. Langdon pictured the darkness of the empty shaft below them. He tried to block it out by staring at the numbered display of changing floors. ",fiction,suspenseful,"Robert Langdon, Vittoria Vetra, Maximilian Kohler, Bob Brownell, Charles Pratt","NARRATOR:

""It sounds fine,"" said Dick. ""How does it belong to you, Georgina?"" George glared at him and didn't answer. ""Sorry,"" said Dick, hastily. ""I didn't mean to call you Georgina. I meant to call you George."" ""Go on, George— tell us how the island belongs to you,"" said Julian, slipping his arm through his sulky little cousin's. She pulled away from him at once. ""Don't do that,"" she said. ""I'm not sure that I want to make friends with you yet."" ""All right, all right,"" said Julian, losing patience. ""Be enemies or anything you like. We don't care. But we like your mother awfully, and we don't want her to think we won't make friends with you."" ""Do you like my mother?"" said George, her bright blue eyes softening a little. ""Yes— she's a dear, isn't she? Well— all right— I'll tell you how Kirrin Castle belongs to me. Come and sit down here in this corner where nobody can hear us."" They all sat down in a sandy corner of the beach. George looked across at the little island in the bay.",fiction,optimistic,"George, Dick, Julian, Aunt Fanny","NARRATOR: 
The three children stood on Kirrin Beach, staring at George in utter amazement. George, with her fierce blue eyes, stared back at them defiantly.

DICK: 
What do you mean?

GEORGE: 
(angrily) 
Kirrin Island can't belong to you. You're just boasting.

DICK: 
(skeptically) 
No, I'm not.

GEORGE: 
You ask Mother. If you don't believe me, I won't tell you anything else. But I never tell lies. I think it's cowardly to do so.

V.O. (George) ```
        I hope they believe me. I don't like lying, but I can't help it if they don't trust me. Mother will know the truth. I'll show them how brave I am. I won't let them make fun of me. I'll show them that I'm not just making up stories.

JULIAN: 
(scratching his head) 
Well, we'll believe you if you tell us the truth.

GEORGE: 
(determined) 
I will. But it does sound extraordinary, you know. Children don't usually own islands.

NARRATOR: 
George's face lit up as she described the beauty of her island, with its tame rabbits and majestic cormorants. The children sat down in a sandy corner, hidden from prying eyes, as George revealed the story of how Kirrin Castle came to belong to her. The sound of the waves crashing against the shore and the salty sea breeze added to the magic of the moment. Despite their initial doubts, the children couldn't help but be captivated by George's tale.

GEORGE: 
(excitedly) 
And there's a secret passage in the castle that leads to a hidden treasure room!

DICK: 
(in awe) 
Wow, that's amazing!

V.O. (Dick) Wow, that's amazing! I can't believe George actually owns Kirrin Island. She's so brave and honest. I wish I could be like her. Maybe I should start being more truthful too. This is such an incredible story, I can't wait to hear more.

JULIAN: 
(curiously) 
But how did the island come to belong to you, George?

GEORGE: 
(smiling) 
Well, it all started when my mother inherited it from her great aunt. She passed it down to me, and now it's mine.

V.O. (George) Wow, I can't believe they actually believe me. I mean, I know it's true, but it's still hard to convince them. I'm so glad I have this island to myself. It's my refuge, my sanctuary. And now, I have friends to share it with. This is perfect.

AUNT FANNY: 
(narrating) 
I remember when I first visited Kirrin Island as a child. It was love at first sight. The wild beauty of the island captured my heart, and I knew it would always hold a special place in my family's history.

V.O. (Aunt Fanny) I can't believe they doubted me. Kirrin Island is my home, my sanctuary. It's where I feel most alive. I'll never forget the first time I set foot on this land. And now, to share its story with these children, it's like reliving that magical moment all over again.

GEORGE: 
(proudly) 
And now it's my turn to pass it down to my children someday.

NARRATOR: 
The children were in awe of George's story and couldn't wait to explore the island for themselves. They had found a new friend in George and were eager to learn more about her and her adventurous family.

JULIAN: 
(excitedly) 
Let's go explore the island and see if we can find that secret passage!

GEORGE: 
(grinning) 
Yes, let's go on an adventure!

DICK: 
(enthusiastically) 
I can't wait to see the rabbits and cormorants!

V.O. (Dick) Wow, I never knew George was so brave and determined. She's always been a bit of a mystery to me. But her story about the island and the rabbits and cormorants sounds amazing. Maybe she's not just boasting after all. I can't wait to see it for myself.

NARRATOR: 
And with that, the four children set off to explore Kirrin Island, their hearts full of excitement and wonder. For George, it was a dream come true to share her beloved island with her new friends, and she couldn't wait to see what other adventures awaited them.
