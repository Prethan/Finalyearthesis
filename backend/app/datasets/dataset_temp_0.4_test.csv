"Outside the wall, at the part of the grounds farthest from the public road, were a horse and a light wagon, waiting.  The work of excavation was not difficult: the earth with which the grave had been loosely filled a few hours before offered little resistance and was soon thrown out. Removal of the casket from its box was less easy, but it was taken out, for it was a perquisite of Jess, who carefully unscrewed the cover and laid it aside, exposing the body in black trousers and white shirt. At that instant the air sprang to flame, a cracking shock of thunder shook the stunned world and Henry Armstrong tranquilly sat up. With inarticulate cries the men fled in terror, each in a different direction. For nothing on earth could two of them have been persuaded to return. But Jess was of another breed.  In the grey of the morning the two students, pallid and haggard from anxiety and with the terror of their adventure still beating tumultuously in their blood, met at the medical college.  'You saw it?' cried one.  'God! yes -- what are we to do?'  They went around to the rear of the building, where they saw a horse, attached to a light wagon, hitched to a gatepost near the door of the dissecting-room. Mechanically they entered the room. On a bench in the obscurity sat the negro Jess. He rose, grinning, all eyes and teeth.  'I'm waiting for my pay,' he said.  Stretched naked on a long table lay the body of Henry Armstrong, the head defiled with blood and clay from a blow with a spade.",horror,suspenseful,"Jess, Henry Armstrong, Student 1, Student 2","NARRATOR: 
The grey morning was thick with a sense of dread as the two students, still reeling from their terrifying experience, made their way to the medical college. Their faces were pale and drawn, their eyes wide with fear. They knew they had to act quickly, but they were paralyzed with terror. As they approached the building, they saw a horse and wagon waiting outside, hitched to a gatepost. Inside the building, the air was thick with the smell of death and decay. On a bench in the darkness sat the grinning figure of Jess, waiting for his payment. And on a table in the corner, the body of Henry Armstrong lay naked and defiled, a gruesome reminder of the horrors that lurked within.

NARRATOR: 
The two students looked at each other, their minds racing with fear and confusion. They knew they had to do something, but they had no idea where to start. They decided to go around to the rear of the building, hoping to find a solution.

NARRATOR: 
As they turned the corner, they were met with a shocking sight. A horse, attached to a light wagon, was hitched to a gatepost near the door of the dissecting-room. And on the bench inside, sat the grinning figure of Jess.

JESS: 
(rising and grinning) 
I'm waiting for my pay.

NARRATOR: 
The students were taken aback by Jess's calm demeanor. They couldn't understand how he could be so nonchalant in the face of such terror.

NARRATOR: 
The two students cautiously entered the room, their hearts pounding with fear. On a table in the corner, lay the body of Henry Armstrong, the head defiled with blood and clay from a blow with a spade.

NARRATOR: 
The students looked around the room, searching for a solution. Suddenly, Student 1's eyes fell upon a nearby shovel.

NARRATOR: 
The two students quickly got to work, digging a new grave for Henry's body. As they worked, they couldn't help but feel a sense of unease and dread. But they knew they had to finish the task at hand.

NARRATOR: 
After what seemed like hours, they finally finished burying the body. They stood back, panting and sweating, but relieved that the ordeal was over.

NARRATOR: 
The two students made a pact to keep their terrifying experience a secret. They knew that no one would believe them, and they didn't want to be labeled as crazy. As they left the medical college, they couldn't help but look back at the building, wondering if they would ever return.

NARRATOR: 
Meanwhile, Jess remained in the dissecting-room, waiting for his payment. He had seen many strange things in his line of work, but nothing like this. He couldn't wait to tell his friends about the bizarre events that had taken place.

JESS: 
(grinning to himself) 
This is gonna be a great story to tell.

V.O. (Jess) ""Wow, what a rush! I can't believe we made it out alive. This is definitely going to be a story for the ages. I can't wait to tell everyone about our terrifying adventure. I never thought I'd be grinning after such a horrific experience, but here I am, alive and well. Life is truly unpredictable.""

NARRATOR: 
And as for Henry Armstrong, his body remained buried, but his spirit lingered on, haunting the medical college and those who dared to disturb his final resting place.

"The young woman's glance fell upon them with a distant, swift disinterest; then with a lovely smile brightening her countenance and a tender pink tingeing her rounded cheeks, she held out a little gray-gloved hand. When she spoke her voice, full, sweet, and deliberate, proclaimed that its owner was accustomed to speak and be heard.  ""Well, Mr. Easton, if you will make me speak first, I suppose I must.

"The children were at play in their play-ground one day, when a herald rode through the town, blowing a trumpet, and crying aloud, ""The King! the King passes by this road to-day. Make ready for the King!"" The children stopped their play, and looked at one another.  ""Did you hear that?"" they said. ""The King is coming. He may look over the wall and see our playground; who knows? We must put it in order.""  The playground was sadly dirty, and in the corners were scraps of paper and broken toys, for these were careless children. But now, one brought a hoe, and another a rake, and a third ran to fetch the wheelbarrow from behind the garden gate. They labored hard, till at length all was clean and tidy.  ""Now it is clean!"" they said; ""but we must make it pretty, too, for kings are used to fine things; maybe he would not notice mere cleanness, for he may have it all the time.""  Then one brought sweet rushes and strewed them on the ground; and others made garlands of oak leaves and pine tassels and hung them on the walls; and the littlest one pulled marigold buds and threw them all about the playground, ""to look like gold,"" he said.  When all was done the playground was so beautiful that the children stood and looked at it, and clapped their hands with pleasure.  ""Let us keep it always like this!"" said the littlest one; and the others cried, ""Yes! yes! that is what we will do.""

"Out of the drawer they took about ten little packages of yellow paper, tied with care and arranged one beside the other.

"Josefa was standing in her tracks, quietly reloading her silver- mounted .38. It had not been a difficult shot. The lion's head made an easier mark than a tomato-can swinging at the end of a string. There was a provoking, teasing, maddening smile upon her mouth and in her dark eyes. The would-be-rescuing knight felt the fire of his fiasco burn down to his soul. Here had been his chance, the chance that he had dreamed of; and Momus, and not Cupid, had presided over it. The satyrs in the wood were, no doubt, holding their sides in hilarious, silent laughter. There had been something like vaudeville--say Signor Givens and his funny knockabout act with the stuffed lion.  ""Is that you, Mr. Givens?"" said Josefa, in her deliberate, saccharine contralto. ""You nearly spoilt my shot when you yelled. Did you hurt your head when you fell?""  ""Oh, no,"" said Givens, quietly; ""that didn't hurt."" He stooped ignominiously and dragged his best Stetson hat from under the beast. It was crushed and wrinkled to a fine comedy effect. Then he knelt down and softly stroked the fierce, open-jawed head of the dead lion.  ""Poor old Bill!"" he exclaimed mournfully.  ""What's that?"" asked Josefa, sharply.  ""Of course you didn't know, Miss Josefa,"" said Givens, with an air of one allowing magnanimity to triumph over grief. ""Nobody can blame you. I tried to save him, but I couldn't let you know in time.""  ""Save who?""  ""Why, Bill. I've been looking for him all day. You see, he's been our camp pet for two years. Poor old fellow, he wouldn't have hurt a cottontail rabbit. It'll break the boys all up when they hear about it. But you couldn't tell, of course, that Bill was just trying to play with you.""  Josefa's black eyes burned steadily upon him. Ripley Givens met the test successfully. He stood rumpling the yellow-brown curls on his head pensively. In his eye was regret, not unmingled with a gentle reproach. His smooth features were set to a pattern of indisputable sorrow. Josefa wavered.  ""What was your pet doing here?"" she asked, making a last stand. ""There's no camp near the White Horse Crossing.""  ""The old rascal ran away from camp yesterday,"" answered Givens readily. ",fiction,humorous ,"Josefa, Mr. Givens, Lion (Bill)","NARRATOR: 
The sun was setting over the horizon as Josefa stood in the woods, her silver-mounted .38 in hand as she reloaded. It had been an easy shot, the lion's head an easier target than a swinging tomato-can. Her dark eyes held a teasing smile as she watched the would-be rescuing knight, his fiasco burning down to his soul. The satyrs were surely laughing at his expense. But then, a voice called out.

[SFX : LAUGHING]

JOSEFA: 
Is that you, MR. GIVENS?

JOSEFA: 
(sarcastically) 
Oh no, I'm just standing in the middle of the woods with a loaded gun for fun.

JOSEFA: 
(confused) 
What's that?

JOSEFA: 
(suspicious) 
Save who?

JOSEFA: 
(guilty) 
I...I didn't know. I thought he was attacking me.

V.O. (Josefa) I can't believe I shot their pet lion. I thought it was attacking me. But now I see the truth. I was so caught up in my own revenge, I didn't even stop to think. I'm such a fool. How could I have been so blind?

JOSEFA: 
(defensive) 
I don't have a pet. And there's no camp near the White Horse Crossing.

JOSEFA: 
(softening) 
I'm sorry, Mr. Givens. I didn't mean to...I didn't know.

V.O. (Josefa) Oh no, what have I done? I didn't mean to shoot the lion, I didn't know it was their pet. I thought it was just another target. I hope Mr. Givens can forgive me. I feel terrible. I should have known better. I need to be more careful next time.

JOSEFA: 
(teasing) 
Oh, I'm sure he would have. A lion and a hunter, what a pair we would have made.

V.O. (Josefa) Oh, I'm sure he would have. A lion and a hunter, what a pair we would have made. But it's all just a game, isn't it? A game of power and control. And I'm the one in control now. Poor Mr. Givens, he never stood a chance against me.

NARRATOR: 
And so, as the sun set on the woods, Josefa and Mr. Givens shared a moment of understanding and forgiveness. The satyrs in the woods may have been holding their sides in silent laughter, but for Josefa and Mr. Givens, it was a moment of bittersweet reflection on the unpredictable and often humorous nature of life.

"When Hughie came in he found Trevor putting the finishing touches to a wonderful life-size picture of a beggar-man. The beggar himself was standing on a raised platform in a corner of the studio. He was a wizened old man, with a face like wrinkled parchment, and a most piteous expression. Over his shoulders was flung a coarse brown cloak, all tears and tatters; his thick boots were patched and cobbled, and with one hand he leant on a rough stick, while with the other he held out his battered hat for alms.  'What an amazing model!' whispered Hughie, as he shook hands with his friend.  'An amazing model?' shouted Trevor at the top of his voice; 'I should think so! Such beggars as he are not to be met with every day. A trouvaille, mort cher; a living Velasquez! My stars! what an etching Rembrandt would have made of him!'  'Poor old chap! said Hughie, 'how miserable he looks! But I suppose, to you painters, his face is his fortune?'  'Certainly,' replied Trevor, 'you don't want a beggar to look happy, do you?'  'How much does a model get for sitting?' asked Hughie, as he found himself a comfortable seat on a divan.  'A shilling an hour.'  'And how much do you get for your picture, Alan?'  'Oh, for this I get two thousand!'  'Pounds?'  'Guineas. Painters, poets, and physicians always get guineas.'  'Well, I think the model should have a percentage,' cried Hughie, laughing; 'they work quite as hard as you do.'  'Nonsense, nonsense! Why, look at the trouble of laying on the paint alone, and standing all day long at one's easel! It's all very well, Hughie, for you to talk, but I assure you that there are moments when Art almost attains to the dignity of manual labour. But you mustn't chatter; I'm very busy.

Hughie enters the art studio to find Trevor putting the finishing touches on a life-size picture of a beggar-man. The beggar himself stands on a raised platform in the corner, with a face like wrinkled parchment and a piteous expression.

What an amazing model!

V.O. (Hughie) Wow, what an amazing model! I can't believe Trevor found someone so perfect to capture on canvas. He looks so sad and worn, but Trevor says that's what makes him valuable. I wonder if he knows how much money Trevor will make off of him. Maybe I should suggest he gets a cut.

(proudly) 
A shilling an hour.

HUGHIE: 
(surprised) 
And how much do you get for your picture, Alan?

V.O. (Hughie) ""Wow, two thousand guineas for just a few hours of sitting? That's more than I make in a year! And here I am, worrying about a measly shilling an hour. Maybe I should start posing for artists instead of working at the bank. But then again, that poor old beggar, he deserves a cut too.""

V.O. (Trevor) Ugh, Hughie is such a naive fool. He has no idea what it takes to create a masterpiece. All he sees is the finished product, not the blood, sweat, and tears that go into it. But I can't blame him, he's just a rich boy with no appreciation for true art. I'll just let him think I'm slaving away here, while I bask in the glory of my genius.

V.O. (Trevor) Ah, perfect timing! I was just putting the finishing touches on my masterpiece. I can't wait to show Hughie. He'll be so impressed with my work. I'm so excited to finally have my living Velasquez model. And to think, I'll be getting two thousand guineas for this. What a fortune!

TREVOR: 
(grinning) 
Thank you, my friend. I wanted to capture the essence of poverty and struggle in this painting.

TREVOR: 
(proudly) 
Yes, it will fetch a high price, I'm sure.

And yet, the poor old beggar will only receive a shilling an hour for his hard work.

Yes, it's a shame. But at least he will forever be immortalized in this beautiful painting.

NARRATOR: 
As the men continue to admire Trevor's work, the beggar-man stands silently, his face still reflecting the struggles of poverty and hardship. But for a moment, he is a living Velasquez, a trouvaille, a true representation of the inequality and exploitation in the world of art.

"He seemed unwilling to leave anything to the imagination of a casual observer, and his talk grew presently personal and introspective.  ""I don't know how it is,"" he told his friend, ""I'm not much over forty, but I seem to have settled down into a deep groove of elderly middle-age. My sister shows the same tendency. We like everything to be exactly in its accustomed place; we like things to happen exactly at their appointed times; we like everything to be usual, orderly, punctual, methodical, to a hair's breadth, to a minute. It distresses and upsets us if it is not so. For instance, to take a very trifling matter, a thrush has built its nest year after year in the catkin- tree on the lawn; this year, for no obvious reason, it is building in the ivy on the garden wall. We have said very little about it, but I think we both feel that the change is unnecessary, and just a little irritating.""  ""Perhaps,"" said the friend, ""it is a different thrush.""  ""We have suspected that,"" said J. P. Huddle, ""and I think it gives us even more cause for annoyance. We don't feel that we want a change of thrush at our time of life; and yet, as I have said, we have scarcely reached an age when these things should make themselves seriously felt.""

"Filled with amazement and terror by this apparition of a horseman in the sky--half believing himself the chosen scribe of some new Apocalypse, the officer was overcome by the intensity of his emotions; his legs failed him and he fell. Almost at the same instant he heard a crashing sound in the trees--a sound that died without an echo--and all was still.  The officer rose to his feet, trembling. The familiar sensation of an abraded shin recalled his dazed faculties. Pulling himself together he ran rapidly obliquely away from the cliff to a point distant from its foot; thereabout he expected to find his man; and thereabout he naturally failed. In the fleeting instant of his vision his imagination had been so wrought upon by the apparent grace and ease and intention of the marvelous performance that it did not occur to him that the line of march of arial cavalry is directly downward, and that he could find the objects of his search at the very foot of the cliff. A half-hour later he returned to camp.  This officer was a wise man; he knew better than to tell an incredible truth. He said nothing of what he had seen. But when the commander asked him if in his scout he had learned anything of advantage to the expedition he answered:  ""Yes, sir; there is no road leading down into this valley from the southward.""  The commander, knowing better, smiled.  After firing his shot, Private Carter Druse reloaded his rifle and resumed his watch. Ten minutes had hardly passed when a Federal sergeant crept cautiously to him on hands and knees. Druse neither turned his head nor looked at him, but lay without motion or sign of recognition.  ""Did you fire?"" the sergeant whispered.  ""Yes.""  ""At what?""  ""A horse. It was standing on yonder rock--pretty far out. You see it is no longer there. It went over the cliff.""  The man's face was white, but he showed no other sign of emotion. Having answered, he turned away his eyes and said no more. The sergeant did not understand.  ""See here, Druse,"" he said, after a moment's silence, ""it's no use making a mystery. I order you to report. Was there anybody on the horse?""  ""Yes.""  ""Well?""  ""My father.""  The sergeant rose to his feet and walked away. ""Good God!"" he said.",drama,suspenseful,"Officer, commander, Private Carter Druse, Federal sergeant","NARRATOR: 
The officer stood on the edge of the cliff, filled with amazement and terror as he gazed up at the horseman in the sky. His emotions were overwhelming, and he fell to the ground, his legs giving out beneath him.

OFFICER: 
(overcome by emotions) 
What is this madness?

V.O. (Officer) ""Madness? No, this is beyond madness. It's a nightmare, a hallucination. How can a horseman be riding in the sky? Am I losing my mind? I must find out the truth. But first, I need to calm down and catch my breath. That was too much to handle.""

As he struggled to regain his composure, he heard a crashing sound in the trees, followed by an eerie silence. Trembling, he rose to his feet and ran away from the cliff, searching for the mysterious horseman.

OFFICER: 
(calling out) 
Who goes there?

NARRATOR: 
But as he soon realized, the horseman's path was not one of flight, but of descent.

OFFICER: 
(realization dawning) 
No, it can't be...

V.O. (Officer) No, it can't be... realization dawning. That horseman in the sky, it's impossible. But I saw it with my own eyes. The fear and awe that consumed me, it's unlike anything I've ever felt before. And now, the silence and the crashing, what does it all mean? I must find out.

NARRATOR: 
And as the officer returned to camp, he knew better than to reveal the incredible truth of what he had witnessed.

(concerned) 
What happened, officer?

(resigned) 
Nothing of importance, sir.

NARRATOR: 
Meanwhile, Private Carter Druse, a young and brave soldier, was a man of few words. He was filled with awe and fear when he saw a horseman in the sky, and fell to the ground in disbelief.

PRIVATE CARTER DRUSE: 
(whispering to himself) 
What is this sorcery?

NARRATOR: 
As he regained his senses, he realized that he was on a mission to find a man, but his imagination was so captivated by the horseman that he didn't realize the direction of the cavalry's march.

(calling out) 
Father, where are you?

V.O. (Private Carter Druse) Father, where are you? Did you see that? That horseman in the sky, it's like something out of a dream. But it was real, wasn't it? I can't believe what I just saw. I need to find him, I need to know the truth. But I can't let anyone else know, they'll think I'm crazy.

Inner Monologue: What is going on? That horseman in the sky, it can't be real. But the crashing sound, the eerie silence... I need to find out more. But wait, why is he descending? I can't let anyone know, they'll think I'm crazy. I need to keep this to myself.

PRIVATE CARTER DRUSE: 
(evading) 
Nothing of importance, sir.

V.O. (Private Carter Druse) Private Carter Druse's inner monologue: ""I can't believe what I just saw. That horseman in the sky, it's like something out of a nightmare. But I can't let anyone know, especially not the officer. I'll just say it was nothing, and pray that I never see that terrifying sight again.""

NARRATOR: 
Despite his stoic demeanor, he was deeply affected by the tragic events he witnessed and carried the weight of his actions on his shoulders.

FEDERAL SERGEANT: 
(solemn) 
We must continue our mission. Our duty is to our country.

"That night the city wore the mask of a capital. The five young men strolled along Stephen's Green in a faint cloud of aromatic smoke. They talked loudly and gaily and their cloaks dangled from their shoulders. The people made way for them. At the corner of Grafton Street a short fat man was putting two handsome ladies on a car in charge of another fat man. The car drove off and the short fat man caught sight of the party.  ""Andre.""  ""It's Farley!""  A torrent of talk followed. Farley was an American. No one knew very well what the talk was about. Villona and Riviere were the noisiest, but all the men were excited. They got up on a car, squeezing themselves together amid much laughter. They drove by the crowd, blended now into soft colours, to a music of merry bells. They took the train at Westland Row and in a few seconds, as it seemed to Jimmy, they were walking out of Kingstown Station. The ticket-collector saluted Jimmy; he was an old man:  ""Fine night, sir!""  It was a serene summer night; the harbour lay like a darkened mirror at their feet. They proceeded towards it with linked arms, singing Cadet Roussel in chorus, stamping their feet at every:  ""Ho! Ho! Hohe, vraiment!""  They got into a rowboat at the slip and made out for the American's yacht. There was to be supper, music, cards. Villona said with conviction:  ""It is delightful!""  There was a yacht piano in the cabin. Villona played a waltz for Farley and Riviere, Farley acting as cavalier and Riviere as lady. Then an impromptu square dance, the men devising original figures. What merriment! Jimmy took his part with a will; this was seeing life, at least. Then Farley got out of breath and cried ""Stop!"" A man brought in a light supper, and the young men sat down to it for form's sake. They drank, however: it was Bohemian. They drank Ireland, England, France, Hungary, the United States of America. Jimmy made a speech, a long speech, Villona saying: ""Hear! hear!"" whenever there was a pause. There was a great clapping of hands when he sat down. It must have been a good speech. Farley clapped him on the back and laughed loudly. What jovial fellows! What good company they were!",fiction,optimistic,"Five young men, Farley, Villona, Riviere, Jimmy","FIVE YOUNG MEN:

The old dog hoarsely and lazily barked behind the gate. The doctor's windows were in darkness. All was silence.  ""For God's sake, for God's sake!"" whispered Nellie.  But at last the garden gate creaked and Nellie saw the doctor's cook.  ""Is the doctor at home?""  ""His honour's asleep,"" whispered the cook into her sleeve, as though afraid of waking her master.

Running through some dark and stuffy rooms, upsetting two or three chairs, she at last reached the doctor's bedroom.

Please, I don't care how tired he is. My husband's life is in danger.

NARRATOR: 
The cook hesitates, but then nods and leads Nellie inside. They make their way through the dark and stuffy rooms, knocking over a few chairs in the process. They finally reach the doctor's bedroom, where he is lying on his bed, dressed but without his coat.

STEPAN LUKITCH: 
(action or expression) 
What is it?

NELLIE: 
My husband is ill! Please, you must come quickly.

STEPAN LUKITCH: 
(action or expression) 
What's wrong with him?

NELLIE: 
He's burning up with fever. He's in so much pain.

STEPAN LUKITCH: 
(action or expression) 
I see.

NARRATOR: 
The doctor sits up and rubs his eyes, trying to shake off his exhaustion. Nellie's sobs grow louder as she describes her husband's condition.

NELLIE: 
(action or expression) 
He's delirious and in so much pain. Please, you have to help him.

STEPAN LUKITCH: 
(action or expression) 
I'll come with you. But you must stay calm, Nellie. I can't help your husband if you're in a state of panic.

NELLIE: 
(action or expression) 
I'll try.

NARRATOR: 
The doctor quickly gets dressed and follows Nellie back to her home. As they walk, Nellie's sobs turn into quiet sniffles. The doctor's cook stays behind, but her thoughts are with the doctor and the poor, sick man he's going to help.

NARRATOR: 
The doctor and Nellie arrive at her home, where her husband is lying in bed, his face flushed with fever. The doctor quickly examines him and prescribes some medicine.

STEPAN LUKITCH: 
(action or expression) 
He'll need to rest and take this medicine. I'll check in on him tomorrow.

V.O. (Stepan Lukitch) Stepan Lukitch's heart ached as he watched Nellie's desperation. He knew the gravity of the situation, but he couldn't let his emotions show. He'll need to rest and take this medicine. I'll check in on him tomorrow. But for now, I must remain calm and focused.

NELLIE: 
Thank you, doctor. Thank you so much.

NARRATOR: 
The doctor nods and leaves, exhausted but satisfied that he was able to help. Nellie stays by her husband's side, relieved that he's finally getting the care he needs. The doctor's cook returns to the doctor's house, where she finds him fast asleep in his bed.

NARRATOR: 
The cook smiles and quietly closes the door, knowing that the doctor will be ready to help anyone who needs him when he wakes up.

"It was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season, that I encountered my friend. He accosted me with excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much. The man wore motley. He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him that I thought I should never have done wringing his hand.  I said to him --""My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met. How remarkably well you are looking to-day. But I have received a pipe of what passes for Amontillado, and I have my doubts.""  ""How?"" said he. ""Amontillado, A pipe? Impossible! And in the middle of the carnival!""  ""I have my doubts,"" I replied; ""and I was silly enough to pay the full Amontillado price without consulting you in the matter. You were not to be found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.""  ""Amontillado!""  ""I have my doubts.""  ""Amontillado!""  ""And I must satisfy them.""  ""Amontillado!""  ""As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchresi. If any one has a critical turn it is he. He will tell me --""  ""Luchresi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.""  ""And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your own.  ""Come, let us go.""  ""Whither?""  ""To your vaults.""  ""My friend, no; I will not impose upon your good nature. I perceive you have an engagement. Luchresi--""  ""I have no engagement; --come.""  ""My friend, no. It is not the engagement, but the severe cold with which I perceive you are afflicted. The vaults are insufferably damp. They are encrusted with nitre.""  ""Let us go, nevertheless. The cold is merely nothing. Amontillado! You have been imposed upon. And as for Luchresi, he cannot distinguish Sherry from Amontillado.""  Thus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm; and putting on a mask of black silk and drawing a roquelaire closely about my person, I suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.",horror,mysterious,"Narrator, Fortunato, Luchresi","NARRATOR: 
(voiceover) 
The sun sets on the carnival, casting an eerie glow over the revelers. Amidst the chaos, a figure emerges, dressed in motley and wearing a conical cap and bells. It is Fortunato, a close friend of the Narrator, who is greeted with excessive warmth.

FORTUNATO: 
My dear friend, how fortuitous to encounter you here. The carnival is in full swing, and I have been indulging in the finest wines and spirits.

NARRATOR: 
(smiling) 
I can see that. You are looking quite merry, my friend.

FORTUNATO: 
(boisterously) 
And why shouldn't I be? It is the carnival season, after all. But what is this you speak of? A pipe of Amontillado?

NARRATOR: 
(nodding) 
Yes, a rare and expensive wine. I have my doubts about its authenticity, though.

FORTUNATO: 
(impatiently) 
Doubts? Nonsense! I have never known you to be so skeptical. And to think, you paid the full Amontillado price without consulting me.

NARRATOR: 
(sighing) 
I couldn't find you, my friend. And I was afraid of losing a bargain.

FORTUNATO: 
(eyes lighting up) 
Amontillado! Let us taste it and put your doubts to rest.

V.O. (Fortunato) FORTUNATO's eyes light up at the mention of Amontillado. But as they make their way through the dark, damp vaults, a sense of unease settles in. Is this a trap? What secrets lie within these walls? I must be cautious, for my fate may be sealed in these very vaults.

NARRATOR: 
(shaking head) 
No, not yet. I must first satisfy my doubts.

FORTUNATO: 
(becoming agitated) 
Satisfy your doubts? How dare you! I am a connoisseur of fine wines, and I assure you, Amontillado is not easily mistaken for anything else.

NARRATOR: 
(smiling) 
I have no doubt about your taste, my friend. But there is another who claims to have a critical eye for wine, even more so than you.

FORTUNATO: 
(disbelieving) 
Impossible! Who is this Luchresi you speak of?

NARRATOR: 
(leaning in) 
He is a man of great knowledge and sophistication, much like yourself. But unlike you, he has never been known to indulge in too much wine.

FORTUNATO: 
(eyes narrowing) 
And yet, you trust his opinion over mine?

NARRATOR: 
(winking) 
I trust no one's opinion over yours, my friend. But I am curious to see if Luchresi can tell Amontillado from Sherry.

FORTUNATO: 
(grinning) 
Well then, let us go to your vaults and put this Luchresi to the test.

NARRATOR: 
(shrugging) 
As you wish. But I must warn you, the vaults are damp and cold, encrusted with nitre.

FORTUNATO: 
(dismissing) 
Bah! The cold is nothing. And as for Luchresi, he cannot distinguish Sherry from Amontillado.

NARRATOR: 
(smiling) 
Then let us go, my friend. But first, let me fetch my mask and roquelaire.

FORTUNATO: 
(nodding) 
Yes, we must be discreet. The carnival is no place for a private tasting.

NARRATOR: 
(voiceover) 
Fortunato and the Narrator make their way to the palazzo, where the vaults are located. But as they descend into the damp, dark depths, a sense of unease settles in.

FORTUNATO: 
(shivering) 
The cold is unbearable. And the dampness...it seeps into my bones.

V.O. (Fortunato) The cold is unbearable, and the dampness seeps into my bones. Shivering, I try to ignore the unease settling in. What secrets lie within these vaults? And what fate awaits us? I can't shake off this feeling of dread. But maybe it's just the alcohol.

NARRATOR: 
(concerned) 
Perhaps we should turn back, my friend. The vaults are not a place for the faint of heart.

FORTUNATO: 
(determined) 
No, we must continue. I must prove my superior taste to this Luchresi.

V.O. (Fortunato) As we descend into the vaults, I can feel my determination growing. I will not be outdone by Luchresi, not when it comes to wine. But the air is heavy and my friend's drunken ramblings are starting to make me uneasy. What secrets lie within these walls?

NARRATOR: 
(sighing) 
As you wish. But let us make it quick.

FORTUNATO: 
(nodding) 
Agreed. Amontillado awaits us.

NARRATOR: 
(voiceover) 
And so, the two friends venture deeper into the vaults, unaware of the fate that awaits them. Will they find the elusive Amontillado, or will they discover something far more sinister? Only time will tell.

"The Skin Horse had lived longer in the nursery than any of the others. He was so old that his brown coat was bald in patches and showed the seams underneath, and most of the hairs in his tail had been pulled out to string bead necklaces. He was wise, for he had seen a long succession of mechanical toys arrive to boast and swagger, and by-and-by break their mainsprings and pass away, and he knew that they were only toys, and would never turn into anything else. For nursery magic is very strange and wonderful, and only those playthings that are old and wise and experienced like the Skin Horse understand all about it.  ""What is REAL?"" asked the Rabbit one day, when they were lying side by side near the nursery fender, before Nana came to tidy the room. ""Does it mean having things that buzz inside you and a stick-out handle?""  ""Real isn't how you are made,"" said the Skin Horse. ""It's a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real.""  ""Does it hurt?"" asked the Rabbit.  ""Sometimes,"" said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful. ""When you are Real you don't mind being hurt.""  ""Does it happen all at once, like being wound up,"" he asked, ""or bit by bit?""  ""It doesn't happen all at once,"" said the Skin Horse. ""You become. It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand.""  ""I suppose you are Real?"" said the Rabbit. And then he wished he had not said it, for he thought the Skin Horse might be sensitive. But the Skin Horse only smiled.",fiction,optimistic,"Skin Horse, Rabbit, Nana","NARRATOR: 
The sun shone brightly through the nursery windows, casting a warm glow over the room. The Skin Horse, with his patchy coat and missing tail hairs, sat beside the Rabbit on the hearth. The smell of freshly baked cookies wafted in from the kitchen, mingling with the faint scent of lavender from the linens. The Skin Horse spoke with wisdom and kindness, his voice like a soothing lullaby. The Rabbit listened intently, his button eyes wide with wonder. Outside, the birds sang and the flowers bloomed, a testament to the magic of the nursery. This was a place where toys became real, and love was the greatest magic of all.

What is REAL?

(action or expression) 
Does it mean having things that buzz inside you and a stick-out handle?

[SFX : BUZZ]

SKIN HORSE: 
(action or expression) 
Real isn't how you are made. It's a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real.

RABBIT: 
(action or expression) 
Does it hurt?

SKIN HORSE: 
(action or expression) 
Sometimes. When you are Real you don't mind being hurt.

RABBIT: 
(action or expression) 
Does it happen all at once, like being wound up, or bit by bit?

SKIN HORSE: 
(action or expression) 
It doesn't happen all at once. You become. It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby.

I suppose you are Real?

NARRATOR: 
The Rabbit's eyes widened in amazement. She had never met a Real toy before. She looked at the Skin Horse with admiration and curiosity.

RABBIT: 
(action or expression) 
How did you become Real, Skin Horse?

SKIN HORSE: 
(action or expression) 
(sighing)

V.O. (Skin Horse) (sighing) I may be old and worn, but I still have so much to offer. My patchy coat and missing tail hairs may make me imperfect, but my wisdom and kindness make me valuable. I may be just a toy, but in this magical nursery, I am real and loved.

NARRATOR: 
The Rabbit listened intently as the Skin Horse shared his wisdom. She knew that she wanted to become Real too, and she was determined to learn all she could.

RABBIT: 
(action or expression) 
But what about Nana? Is she Real too?

SKIN HORSE: 
(action or expression) 
(smiling)

NARRATOR: 
The Rabbit looked over at Nana, the wise and experienced character who had lived in the nursery for so long. She saw the bald patches on Nana's coat and the seams showing, but she also saw the kindness and love in Nana's eyes.

RABBIT: 
(action or expression) 
Nana, can you tell me about becoming Real?

NANA: 
(action or expression) 
(sighing)

NARRATOR: 
The Rabbit smiled, feeling hopeful and excited about her own journey to becoming Real. She knew that with the guidance of the Skin Horse and Nana, she would one day be a Real toy too.

RABBIT: 
(action or expression) 
Thank you, Skin Horse and Nana. I can't wait to become Real like you.

V.O. (Rabbit) Wow, Skin Horse and Nana are so wise and kind. I can't wait to become Real like them. The sun is so warm, the smell of cookies and lavender is so comforting. This is a magical place, where love makes everything possible. I'm so lucky to be here.

SKIN HORSE: 
(action or expression) 
(smiling)

NARRATOR: 
And as the sun continued to shine through the nursery windows, the toys basked in the warmth and love of the room. They knew that they were part of something special, something magical. And they were grateful to be a part of it all.

"I walked and walked along the cold wet sand, making my chattering teeth warble in honour of cold and hunger, when suddenly, as I was carefully searching for something to eat behind one of the empty crates, I perceived behind it, crouching on the ground, a figure in woman's clothes dank with the rain and clinging fast to her stooping shoulders. Standing over her, I watched to see what she was doing. It appeared that she was digging a trench in the sand with her hands--digging away under one of the crates.  ""Why are you doing that?"" I asked, crouching down on my heels quite close to her.  She gave a little scream and was quickly on her legs again. Now that she stood there staring at me, with her wide-open grey eyes full of terror, I perceived that it was a girl of my own age, with a very pleasant face embellished unfortunately by three large blue marks. This spoilt her, although these blue marks had been distributed with a remarkable sense of proportion, one at a time, and all were of equal size--two under the eyes, and one a little bigger on the forehead just over the bridge of the nose. This symmetry was evidently the work of an artist well inured to the business of spoiling the human physiognomy.  The girl looked at me, and the terror in her eyes gradually died out... She shook the sand from her hands, adjusted her cotton head-gear, cowered down, and said:  ""I suppose you too want something to eat? Dig away then! My hands are tired. Over there""--she nodded her head in the direction of a booth--""there is bread for certain ... and sausages too... That booth is still carrying on business.""  I began to dig. She, after waiting a little and looking at me, sat down beside me and began to help me.  We worked in silence. I cannot say now whether I thought at that moment of the criminal code, of morality, of proprietorship, and all the other things about which, in the opinion of many experienced persons, one ought to think every moment of one's life. Wishing to keep as close to the truth as possible, I must confess that apparently I was so deeply engaged in digging under the crate that I completely forgot about everything else except this one thing: What could be inside that crate?  The evening drew on. ",fiction,mysterious,"Narrator, Girl","NARRATOR:

The cold, wet sand squished beneath my feet as I walked along the desolate beach, my teeth chattering uncontrollably from the biting wind. Hunger gnawed at my stomach, urging me to find something to eat. As I searched behind an empty crate, I suddenly noticed a figure crouched on the ground, hidden by the rain-soaked clothes clinging to their stooped shoulders.

GIRL: 
(startled) 
Ahh!

NARRATOR: 
Curiosity got the best of me and I watched as the figure dug a trench in the sand with their bare hands. When I finally approached, I saw that it was a girl around my age, her face marred by three symmetrical blue marks.

GIRL: 
(terrified) 
Please don't hurt me!

V.O. (Girl) Please don't hurt me! I'm so scared, alone and hungry. Who is this girl? Why is she here? Why is she digging? Is she going to hurt me? I don't know what to do. But maybe, just maybe, she can help me find food.

NARRATOR: 
I held up my hands in a peaceful gesture.

NARRATOR: 
(calmly) 
I won't hurt you. I was just curious about what you were doing.

GIRL: 
(relieved) 
Oh, thank goodness. I was just looking for something to eat.

(nodding) 
Same here. My name is Jack. What's yours?

GIRL: 
(smiling) 
I'm Lily.

NARRATOR: 
(voiceover) 
Despite her initial terror, Lily soon warmed up to me and we both worked together in silence to uncover what lay hidden under the crate. The evening grew darker, but we continued to dig, consumed by the mystery of what we might find.

LILY: 
(curious) 
What do you think could be under here?

V.O. (Lily) ""What could be under here? Maybe a hidden treasure or a secret message. I can't believe I found someone else here. Maybe we can work together and find out. I hope she's not dangerous. I'm so cold and hungry, but this is more interesting than anything I've found on this beach.""

JACK: 
(thoughtfully) 
I'm not sure. Maybe some food or supplies that someone left behind.

LILY: 
(hopeful) 
That would be amazing.

V.O. (Lily) ```
That would be amazing. Maybe she knows where to find food. She looks scared, but I can't just leave her here. What if there's something valuable under the crate? We have to keep digging. I have to find out what's going on.

NARRATOR: 
(voiceover) 
As we dug deeper, we uncovered a small wooden box. We exchanged excited glances before carefully opening it.

LILY: 
(amazed) 
Wow, it's full of bread and sausages!

V.O. (Lily) Wow, it's full of bread and sausages! I can't believe my luck. I was so hungry, but now I can finally satisfy my growling stomach. I wonder who left all this food here. Maybe they'll come back soon. I hope they don't mind if I take a little bit.

JACK: 
(grinning) 
Looks like we hit the jackpot.

We shared the food and talked for hours, getting to know each other. As the night grew colder, we huddled together for warmth.

LILY: 
(grateful) 
Thank you for helping me, Jack. I don't know what I would have done without you.

V.O. (Lily) Thank you, Jack. I'm so grateful for your help. I was lost and alone, but you showed me kindness. I never thought I'd find a friend in this desolate place. But now, as we dig together, I feel a sense of hope and purpose. Thank you for being here.

JACK: 
(smiling) 
I'm just glad we found each other. We can survive this together.

NARRATOR: 
(voiceover) 
And from that day on, Jack and Lily became inseparable, surviving the harsh conditions of the beach together. As for the mysterious crate, they never did find out who left it there or why. But it didn't matter, because they had each other. And that was all they needed.

"Olenka, the daughter of the retired collegiate assessor, Plemyanniakov, was sitting in her back porch, lost in thought. It was hot, the flies were persistent and teasing, and it was pleasant to reflect that it would soon be evening. Dark rainclouds were gathering from the east, and bringing from time to time a breath of moisture in the air.  Kukin, who was the manager of an open-air theatre called the Tivoli, and who lived in the lodge, was standing in the middle of the garden looking at the sky.  ""Again!"" he observed despairingly. ""It's going to rain again! Rain every day, as though to spite me. I might as well hang myself! It's ruin! Fearful losses every day.""  He flung up his hands, and went on, addressing Olenka:  ""There! that's the life we lead, Olga Semyonovna. It's enough to make one cry. One works and does one's utmost, one wears oneself out, getting no sleep at night, and racks one's brain what to do for the best. And then what happens? To begin with, one's public is ignorant, boorish. I give them the very best operetta, a dainty masque, first rate music-hall artists. But do you suppose that's what they want! They don't understand anything of that sort. They want a clown; what they ask for is vulgarity. And then look at the weather! Almost every evening it rains. It started on the tenth of May, and it's kept it up all May and June. It's simply awful! The public doesn't come, but I've to pay the rent just the same, and pay the artists.""  The next evening the clouds would gather again, and Kukin would say with an hysterical laugh:  ""Well, rain away, then! Flood the garden, drown me! Damn my luck in this world and the next! Let the artists have me up! Send me to prison! -- to Siberia! -- the scaffold! Ha, ha, ha!""  And next day the same thing.  Olenka listened to Kukin with silent gravity, and sometimes tears came into her eyes. In the end his misfortunes touched her; she grew to love him. He was a small thin man, with a yellow face, and curls combed forward on his forehead.

"This did not long sustain his drooping spirit. He was mentally adrift upon the Hints and Helps to Young Men in Business and Social Relations, which had suggested to him his present enterprise, when the appearance of a second youth, taller and broader than himself, with a shock of light curling hair and a crop of freckles that advertised a rich soil threw him a lifeline. He put his thumbs to his lips and whistled in a peculiarly ear-splitting way. The two boys had sat on the same bench at Sunday-school not three hours before; yet what a change had come over the world for one of them since then!  ""Hello! Where you goin', Ab?"" asked the newcomer, gruffly.  ""Callin',"" replied the boy in the collar, laconically, but with carefully averted gaze.  ""On the girls?"" inquired the other, awestruck. In Mount Pisgah you saw the girls home from night church, socials, or parties; you could hang over the gate; and you might walk with a girl in the cemetery of a Sunday afternoon; but to ring a front-door bell and ask for Miss Heart's Desire one must have been in long trousers at least three years”and the two boys confronted in the dusty road had worn these dignifying garments barely six months.  ""Girls,"" said Abner, loftily; ""I don't know about girls”I'm just going to call on one girl”Champe Claiborne."" He marched on as though the conversation was at an end; but Ross hung upon his flank. Ross and Champe were neighbors, comrades in all sorts of mischief; he was in doubt whether to halt Abner and pummel him, or propose to enlist under his banner.  ""Do you reckon you could?"" he debated, trotting along by the irresponsive Jilton boy.  ""Run home to your mother,"" growled the originator of the plan, savagely. ""You ain't old enough to call on girls; anybody can see that; but I am, and I'm going to call on Champe Claiborne.""  Again the name acted as a spur on Ross. ""With your collar and boots all dirty?"" he jeered. ""They won't know you're callin'.""  The boy in the road stopped short in his dusty tracks. He was an intense creature, and he whitened at the tragic insinuation, longing for the wholesome stay and companionship of freckle-faced Ross.

Nice collar, Ab. Did you roll around in the dirt before we left?

"Mr. Pneumonia was not what you would call a chivalric old gentleman. A mite of a little woman with blood thinned by California zephyrs was hardly fair game for the red-fisted, short-breathed old duffer. But Johnsy he smote; and she lay, scarcely moving, on her painted iron bedstead, looking through the small Dutch window-panes at the blank side of the next brick house.  One morning the busy doctor invited Sue into the hallway with a shaggy, gray eyebrow.  ""She has one chance in - let us say, ten,"" he said, as he shook down the mercury in his clinical thermometer. "" And that chance is for her to want to live. This way people have of lining-u on the side of the undertaker makes the entire pharmacopoeia look silly. Your little lady has made up her mind that she's not going to get well. Has she anything on her mind?""  ""She - she wanted to paint the Bay of Naples some day."" said Sue.  ""Paint? - bosh! Has she anything on her mind worth thinking twice - a man for instance?""  ""A man?"" said Sue, with a jew's-harp twang in her voice. ""Is a man worth - but, no, doctor; there is nothing of the kind.""  ""Well, it is the weakness, then,"" said the doctor. ""I will do all that science, so far as it may filter through my efforts, can accomplish. But whenever my patient begins to count the carriages in her funeral procession I subtract 50 per cent from the curative power of medicines. If you will get her to ask one question about the new winter styles in cloak sleeves I will promise you a one-in-five chance for her, instead of one in ten.""  After the doctor had gone Sue went into the workroom and cried a Japanese napkin to a pulp. Then she swaggered into Johnsy's room with her drawing board, whistling ragtime.  Johnsy lay, scarcely making a ripple under the bedclothes, with her face toward the window. Sue stopped whistling, thinking she was asleep.  She arranged her board and began a pen-and-ink drawing to illustrate a magazine story. Young artists must pave their way to Art by drawing pictures for magazine stories that young authors write to pave their way to Literature.  As Sue was sketching a pair of elegant horseshow riding trousers and a monocle of the figure of the hero, an Idaho cowboy, she heard a low sound, several times repeated.",drama,optimistic,"Mr. Pneumonia, Johnsy, Sue, Doctor, Behrman","NARRATOR: 
The hospital room is quiet, save for the sound of the clock ticking and the occasional beep of the machines. The sunlight streams in through the small Dutch window-panes, casting a warm glow on the walls. The smell of disinfectant lingers in the air, mixed with the faint scent of flowers from the vase on the bedside table. Sue sits at her drawing board, the scratch of her pen against the paper filling the room. She looks over at Johnsy, who lies still, her face turned towards the window. But then, a low sound breaks the silence, and Sue's heart swells with hope.

I-I don't want to die.

Sue's fists clenched as she watched Mr. Pneumonia taunt her friend. She knew she had to do something, anything, to save Johnsy.

SUE: 
(determined) 
Johnsy, listen to me. You can't give up. You have so much to live for.

V.O. (Sue) Sue's heart aches as she watches Johnsy, her determined words falling on deaf ears. But as the quiet hospital room is filled with the sound of Johnsy's faint breaths, Sue's determination is renewed. She knows Johnsy has so much to live for, and she won't give up until she sees her friend's smile again.

JOHNSY: 
(despondent) 
Like what? I have no family, no career, no man to love.

SUE: 
(sympathetic) 
But you have me. And you have your dreams. Remember the Bay of Naples? You have to paint it one day.

[SFX : BAY]

V.O. (Sue) Sue's heart aches for Johnsy, lying so still in the hospital bed. But she knows she can't give up, not when she has her dreams and her friendship with Johnsy. She remembers the Bay of Naples, and the urge to paint it grows stronger. Maybe one day, they'll go there together.

JOHNSY: 
(sighs) 
It's just a silly dream. I'll never get better.

V.O. (Johnsy) ""It's just a silly dream. I'll never get better."" Johnsy sighs, her voice heavy with defeat. The hospital room is so quiet, it's suffocating. The ticking clock and beeping machines just remind me of how fragile life is. But then, a low sound breaks the silence. Could it be a sign of improvement? Maybe there's still hope.

DOCTOR: 
(entering the room) 
Not with that attitude, you won't. I've seen plenty of patients like you, Johnsy. They give up, and then they're gone. But you're different. You have a chance.

V.O. (Doctor) Doctor: Entering the room, I can feel the weight of the situation. Johnsy's condition is serious, but I won't let her give up. I've seen too many patients lose hope, but she's different. I can sense it. There's still a chance for her, and I won't let her waste it.

JOHNSY: 
(bitterly) 
A one-in-ten chance. What's the point?

DOCTOR: 
(smirks) 
Well, if you're not interested in living, perhaps you'd like to hear about the new winter styles in cloak sleeves?

JOHNSY: 
(confused) 
What does that have to do with anything?

DOCTOR: 
(grinning) 
It's a test, my dear. If you can muster up enough interest to ask me about fashion, then I'll give you a one-in-five chance of survival.

NARRATOR: 
Sue's eyes widened in surprise. She had never seen the doctor so optimistic before. She knew she had to help Johnsy find the will to live.

SUE: 
(excitedly) 
Johnsy, did you hear that? You have a chance! All you have to do is ask about fashion.

V.O. (Sue) Sue's heart races as she hears Johnsy's voice, filled with excitement and hope. She can't believe it - a chance to break through Johnsy's depression. She quickly thinks of ways to bring up fashion, hoping it will spark a glimmer of interest in her friend. This could be the turning point.

JOHNSY: 
(smiles weakly) 
I don't know anything about fashion.

SUE: 
(grinning) 
Well, that's why you have me. I'll teach you everything I know.

NARRATOR: 
Sue grabbed her drawing board and began to sketch, determined to lift Johnsy's spirits. As she worked, she heard a low sound coming from Johnsy's bed.

JOHNSY: 
(whispering) 
Thank you, Sue.

SUE: 
(smirks) 
For what? I haven't done anything yet.

JOHNSY: 
(weakly) 
For believing in me. For giving me a reason to live.

V.O. (Johnsy) JOHNSY: For believing in me. For giving me a reason to live. I never thought I'd make it this far. But here I am, fighting for every breath. Sue's dedication to her art, her unwavering presence, gives me strength. I won't give up, not when she's still here.

SUE: 
(tearfully) 
Of course, I believe in you. You're my best friend.

NARRATOR: 
Sue's eyes filled with tears as she continued to draw. She knew that Johnsy was fighting for her life, and she was determined to help her win.

(entering the room) 
What's all this racket? Can't a man get some peace and quiet around here?

SUE: 
(smiling) 
Behrman, you're just in time. We're having a fashion lesson.

BEHRMAN: 
(rolling his eyes) 
Fashion? What do I care about fashion?

SUE: 
(teasing) 
Well, you could use a new pair of pants. Those are looking a bit worn.

BEHRMAN: 
(defensive) 
These pants are fine. And what's wrong with my monocle?

SUE: 
(laughs) 
Nothing, if you're going for the old, grumpy artist look.

NARRATOR: 
Behrman couldn't help but smile at Sue's teasing. He had always admired her spunk and determination. He knew that she would do anything for Johnsy.

BEHRMAN: 
(sincerely) 
Listen, Johnsy. I know I'm not the best company, but if you ever need someone to talk to, I'm here.

V.O. (Behrman) ""I may not be the best at comforting, but I'll try my best. I can't imagine what you're going through, Johnsy. But I'll be here for you, even if it's just to listen. I hope my words can bring some peace to this quiet room.""

JOHNSY: 
(smiles) 
Thank you, Behrman. That means a lot.

NARRATOR: 
As Sue continued to draw and Behrman sat by Johnsy's bedside, the hospital room was filled with laughter and hope. Mr. Pneumonia's grip seemed to loosen, and Johnsy's chances of survival increased with each passing day. And as the days turned into weeks, Johnsy's dream of painting the Bay of Naples became more and more of a possibility. With the love and support of her friends, she found the will to live and to fight against Mr. Pneumonia's hold. And in the end, she emerged victorious, with a new lease on life and a newfound appreciation for the power of friendship.

"Every Sunday he met in this very spot Monsieur Sauvage, a stout, jolly, little man, a draper in the Rue Notre Dame de Lorette, and also an ardent fisherman. They often spent half the day side by side, rod in hand and feet dangling over the water, and a warm friendship had sprung up between the two.  Some days they did not speak; at other times they chatted; but they understood each other perfectly without the aid of words, having similar tastes and feelings.  In the spring, about ten o'clock in the morning, when the early sun caused a light mist to float on the water and gently warmed the backs of the two enthusiastic anglers, Morissot would occasionally remark to his neighbor:  ""My, but it's pleasant here.""  To which the other would reply:  ""I can't imagine anything better!""  And these few words sufficed to make them understand and appreciate each other.  In the autumn, toward the close of day, when the setting sun shed a blood-red glow over the western sky, and the reflection of the crimson clouds tinged the whole river with red, brought a glow to the faces of the two friends, and gilded the trees, whose leaves were already turning at the first chill touch of winter, Monsieur Sauvage would sometimes smile at Morissot, and say:  ""What a glorious spectacle!""  And Morissot would answer, without taking his eyes from his float:  ""This is much better than the boulevard, isn't it?""  As soon as they recognized each other they shook hands cordially, affected at the thought of meeting under such changed circumstances.  Monsieur Sauvage, with a sigh, murmured:  ""These are sad times!""  Morissot shook his head mournfully.  ""And such weather! This is the first fine day of the year.""  The sky was, in fact, of a bright, cloudless blue.  They walked along, side by side, reflective and sad.  ""And to think of the fishing!"" said Morissot. ""What good times we used to have!""  ""When shall we be able to fish again?"" asked Monsieur Sauvage.  They entered a small cafe and took an absinthe together, then resumed their walk along the pavement.  Morissot stopped suddenly.  ""Shall we have another absinthe?"" he said.  ""If you like,"" agreed Monsieur Sauvage.  And they entered another wine shop.  They were quite unsteady when they came out, owing to the effect of the alcohol on their empty stomachs. ",drama,serious,"Monsieur Sauvage, Morissot, Colonel Dumoulin","NARRATOR: 
As the sun shone brightly, casting a warm glow over the riverbank, Monsieur Sauvage and Morissot sat side by side, their feet dangling over the water as they fished. A deep friendship had formed between the two men, their shared love for fishing bringing them together every Sunday.

MONSIEUR SAUVAGE: 
(smiling) 
What a beautiful day for fishing.

MORISSOT: 
(nods) 
Indeed it is.

NARRATOR: 
As they sat in silence, the early morning mist floated over the water, the sun gently warming their backs.

MONSIEUR SAUVAGE: 
(taking a deep breath) 
There's nothing quite like the peacefulness of the river.

V.O. (Monsieur Sauvage) ""Ah, the river. So calm, so serene. Just like the good old days. But now, with everything going on, it's hard to find peace. Maybe a drink will help. But nothing can replace the joy of fishing with Morissot. Memories like these are what keep me going.""

MORISSOT: 
(agreeing) 
It's the perfect escape from the chaos of the city.

V.O. (Morissot) As Morissot looked out at the peaceful river, he couldn't help but agree with Monsieur Sauvage's sentiment. The city was overwhelming, but here on the riverbank, he felt at ease. He wished they could stay here forever, away from the troubles of the world. But reality always crept back in, reminding him of what they had lost.

NARRATOR: 
In the autumn, the setting sun painted the sky a deep red, reflecting off the river and bringing a smile to the faces of the two friends.

MONSIEUR SAUVAGE: 
(looking up at the sky) 
What a glorious spectacle.

V.O. (Monsieur Sauvage) ""What a glorious spectacle,"" Monsieur Sauvage thought, looking up at the sky. But even the beauty of the moment couldn't distract him from the harsh reality of the present. The simple pleasure of fishing with his dear friend Morissot was now overshadowed by the sadness and uncertainty of the world. How he longed for those peaceful days on the riverbank.

MORISSOT: 
(nodding) 
It's moments like these that make life worth living.

V.O. (Morissot) As I sit here, fishing with my dear friend, I can't help but feel grateful for moments like these. The sun, the river, the camaraderie - it all reminds me that life is worth living. But as we walk away, reality sets in. The pain, the uncertainty, the longing for simpler times. Yet, even in our drunken state, we can't help but smile as we remember the good times.

NARRATOR: 
But as they walked along the pavement, their thoughts turned to the present reality - the sad times, the uncertain future, and the longing for the simple pleasure of fishing.

MONSIEUR SAUVAGE: 
(sighing) 
These are difficult times.

V.O. (Monsieur Sauvage) ```
These are difficult times. *sighs* The world is changing, and not for the better. The river used to bring us peace, but now it only reminds us of what we've lost. Absinthe can't numb the pain forever. But at least I have Morissot by my side.

MORISSOT: 
(nodding) 
And such unpredictable weather.

NARRATOR: 
They stopped at a small cafe, taking absinthe to numb the pain. But even in their inebriated state, they couldn't help but reminisce about the good times they had shared on the riverbank.

MONSIEUR SAUVAGE: 
(raising his glass) 
To better days ahead.

V.O. (Monsieur Sauvage) ```
""Ah, to better days ahead. *raises glass* How I long for the peace and simplicity of fishing with Morissot. The sun, the river, the camaraderie. But now, the world is in turmoil. *sips absinthe* How I wish we could turn back time and escape to our beloved riverbank.""

MORISSOT: 
(smiling) 
And to many more fishing trips together.

NARRATOR: 
As they walked along, side by side, reflective and sad, they were joined by their friend Colonel Dumoulin.

COLONEL DUMOULIN: 
(nodding at them) 
Gentlemen.

MONSIEUR SAUVAGE: 
(smiling) 
Colonel Dumoulin, it's good to see you.

V.O. (Monsieur Sauvage) ""Colonel Dumoulin, it's good to see you."" Monsieur Sauvage's smile faltered as he remembered the good times spent fishing with Morissot. The sun's warmth couldn't chase away the sadness that lingered in his heart. How he longed for the simple pleasures of the past, now overshadowed by the uncertain future.

MORISSOT: 
(nodding) 
Indeed it is.

NARRATOR: 
The three men continued their walk, their thoughts turning to their shared love for fishing and the uncertainty of the future.

COLONEL DUMOULIN: 
(looking out at the river) 
What a shame we can't fish today.

MONSIEUR SAUVAGE: 
(nodding) 
But we'll be back here soon enough.

MORISSOT: 
(smiling) 
And when we do, we'll catch the biggest fish yet.

NARRATOR: 
As they reached the end of their walk, they stopped at another wine shop.

MONSIEUR SAUVAGE: 
(raising his glass) 
To friendship and fishing.

V.O. (Monsieur Sauvage) ```
To friendship and fishing. Such simple pleasures, yet so meaningful. The sun's warmth on my back, the gentle sound of the river, and the company of a dear friend. But reality always creeps in, reminding me of the pain and uncertainty. How I long for those peaceful days on the riverbank.

MORISSOT: 
(nodding) 
And to never losing hope.

V.O. (Morissot) ""Nodding, I can't help but think about the good times we've shared on this riverbank. The sun shining, the mist floating, and the deep friendship between us. But now, with the uncertain future and sad times, I hold onto the hope of fishing again. And to never losing hope.""

COLONEL DUMOULIN: 
(smiling) 
To better days ahead.

V.O. (Colonel Dumoulin) ""Ah, to better days indeed. The sun's warmth reminds me of the simpler times, when all that mattered was casting a line with my dear friend. But now, with the world in turmoil, even absinthe can't dull the ache. How I long for those peaceful Sundays by the river.""

NARRATOR: 
And with that, the three friends clinked their glasses and shared a moment of camaraderie, finding solace in each other's company and the shared love for their favorite pastime.

"There is a great deal to recommend a plains journey at first. Later, there is nothing at all to recommend it. It has the same monotony as a voyage at sea, only there is less living room, and, instead of being carried, you must progress to a great extent by your own volition. Also the food is coarse, the water poor, and you cannot bathe. To a plainsman, or a man who has the instinct, these things are as nothing in comparison with the charm of the outdoor life, and the pleasing tingling of adventure. But woman is a creature wedded to comfort. She also has a strange instinctive desire to be entirely alone every once in a while, probably because her experiences, while not less numerous than man's, are mainly psychical, and she needs occasionally time to get ""thought up to date."" So Miss Caldwell began to get very impatient.  The afternoon of the sixth day Alfred, Miss Caldwell, and Allen rode along side by side. Alfred was telling a self-effacing story of adventure, and Miss Caldwell was listening carelessly because she had nothing else to do. Allen chaffed lazily when the fancy took him.  ""I happened to have a limb broken at the time,"" Alfred was observing, parenthetically, in his soft tones, ""and so----""  ""What kind of a limb?"" asked the young Easterner, with direct brutality. He glanced with a half-humourous aside at the girl, to whom the little man had been mainly addressing himself.  Alfred hesitated, blushed, lost the thread of his tale, and finally in great confusion reined back his horse by the harsh Spanish bit. He fell to the rear of the little wagon-train, where he hung his head, and went hot and cold by turns in thinking of such an indiscretion before a lady.  The young Easterner spurred up on the right of the girl's mount.  ""He's the queerest little fellow I ever saw!"" he observed, with a laugh. ""Sorry to spoil his story. Was it a good one?""  ""It might have been if you hadn't spoiled it,"" answered the girl, flicking her horse's ears mischievously. The animal danced. ""What did you do it for?""  ""Oh, just to see him squirm. He'll think about that all the rest of the afternoon, and will hardly dare look you in the face next time you meet.""  ""I know. Isn't he funny? The other morning he came around the corner of the wagon and caught me with my hair down. I wish you could have seen him!""  She laughed gayly at the memory.  ",drama,serious,"Alfred, Miss Caldwell, Allen","NARRATOR: 
The sun blazes down on the vast, open plains, casting a golden hue over the endless expanse. The air is dry and dusty, the only relief coming from the occasional breeze that stirs the tall grass. Hooves beat against the hard-packed earth as the small wagon-train makes its slow progress, the monotony broken only by the soft murmur of conversation.

And then, just as I was about to reach the top of the mountain, a pack of wolves appeared out of nowhere!

V.O. (Alfred) Excitedly, I couldn't believe my luck! A pack of wolves, just as I was reaching the top of the mountain! My heart raced as I imagined the thrill of the chase. But then I remembered Miss Caldwell, and the comfort and solitude she represented. Maybe I should have kept my mouth shut.

MISS CALDWELL: 
(rolling her eyes) 
Oh, please. I've heard this story a hundred times already.

V.O. (Miss Caldwell) Ugh, not this again. Why do I always get stuck with the boring stories? I wish I could just escape this endless journey and find some peace and quiet. Maybe then I wouldn't have to listen to Alfred and his ridiculous tales.

ALLEN: 
(laughing) 
Come on, Miss Caldwell. Let him finish.

ALFRED: 
(continuing his story) 
So, I did the only thing I could think of. I climbed up a nearby tree and waited for them to pass.

MISS CALDWELL: 
(unimpressed) 
And then what? Did you just sit up there all day?

ALFRED: 
(defensively) 
Well, it wasn't exactly a pleasant experience. Those wolves were howling and snarling all around me.

V.O. (Alfred) ""Defensive? Of course I'm defensive. Who wouldn't be after facing a pack of snarling wolves? But I can't let Miss Caldwell see my fear. I'll just have to keep up my bravado and hope she doesn't see through it.""

ALLEN: 
(teasing) 
I bet you were shaking like a leaf.

ALFRED: 
(embarrassed) 
I may have been a little scared, but I managed to hold my own. And in the end, I made it back to camp safely.

MISS CALDWELL: 
(sighing) 
I suppose that's the end of your story?

ALFRED: 
(nodding) 
Yes, I'm afraid so.

NARRATOR: 
Alfred fell silent, feeling a bit deflated by Miss Caldwell's lack of interest. He reined back his horse, falling to the rear of the wagon-train with his head hung low.

ALLEN: 
(riding up to Miss Caldwell's side) 
He's quite the character, isn't he?

MISS CALDWELL: 
(smiling) 
He certainly is. But I do enjoy teasing him.

V.O. (Miss Caldwell) I do enjoy teasing him. It's a welcome distraction from this endless journey. The sun is so hot, and the dust is suffocating. I long for a cool breeze and a quiet place to rest. But for now, I'll settle for a few laughs at Alfred's expense.

ALLEN: 
(grinning) 
I can tell. He's like a little brother to you.

MISS CALDWELL: 
(laughing) 
Yes, I suppose he is.

ALLEN: 
(serious tone) 
I have to admit, I'm not used to this kind of journey. The food, the water, the lack of privacy. It's all a bit much for me.

MISS CALDWELL: 
(sympathetically) 
I understand. But there's something exhilarating about roughing it out here on the plains. Don't you think?

ALLEN: 
(nodding) 
I can see the appeal. But I do miss the comforts of home.

MISS CALDWELL: 
(smiling) 
Well, I'm sure we'll be back to civilization soon enough. But for now, let's enjoy the adventure.

NARRATOR: 
The group continued on their journey, the sun beating down on them as they rode through the endless plains. Despite the discomfort and monotony, there was a sense of camaraderie and adventure that kept them going. And as the day wore on, the sun began to set, casting a beautiful golden light over the vast expanse. The perfect end to another day on the plains.

One day sixteen years later, Thord stood once more in the priest's study.  ""Really, you carry your age astonishingly well, Thord,"" said the priest; for he saw no change whatever in the man.

I should like very much to have him baptized by himself.

PRIEST: 
That is to say on a week-day?

THORD OVERAAS: 
Next Saturday, at twelve o'clock noon.

PRIEST: 
Is there anything else?

THORD OVERAAS: 
There is nothing else.

NARRATOR: 
The priest looked up, curious about Thord's hesitation.

PRIEST: 
There is yet this, however.

NARRATOR: 
The priest walked towards Thord, taking him by the hand and looking gravely into his eyes.

PRIEST: 
God grant that the child may become a blessing to you.

NARRATOR: 
One day sixteen years later, Thord stood once more in the priest's study.

PRIEST: 
Really, you carry your age astonishingly well, Thord.

THORD OVERAAS: 
That is because I have no troubles.

PRIEST: 
What is your pleasure this evening?

THORD OVERAAS: 
I have come this evening about that son of mine who is to be confirmed tomorrow.

PRIEST: 
He is a bright boy.

V.O. (Priest) ""He is a bright boy. I remember when I baptized him, hoping he would bring joy to his father. Now, sixteen years later, he is being confirmed. Thord looks so young and carefree, unlike me. Eight years later, he is getting married, and I am still here, alone. Oh, how I envy him.""

THORD OVERAAS: 
I did not wish to pay the priest until I heard what number the boy would have when he takes his place in church tomorrow.

V.O. (Thord Overaas) I never wanted to pay the priest, but I had to know my son's place in the church. I couldn't risk him being placed below the other boys. I'll do whatever it takes to secure his future. I am Thord Overaas, and I will not let anyone stand in my way.

PRIEST: 
He will stand number one.

THORD OVERAAS: 
So I have heard. And here are ten dollars for the priest.

PRIEST: 
Is there anything else I can do for you?

THORD OVERAAS: 
There is nothing else.

NARRATOR: 
Eight years more rolled by, and then one day a noise was heard outside of the priest's study, for many men were approaching, and at their head was Thord, who entered first.

PRIEST: 
You come well attended this evening, Thord.

THORD OVERAAS: 
I am here to request that the banns may be published for my son. He is about to marry Karen Storliden, daughter of Gudmund, who stands here beside me.

PRIEST: 
Why, that is the richest girl in the parish.

V.O. (Priest) Why, that is the richest girl in the parish. I remember baptizing her sixteen years ago. How time flies. I wonder if she has grown up to be as kind and gentle as her father. I pray that she will bring joy and happiness to her husband, just as she has brought to her father.

THORD OVERAAS: 
So they say.

NARRATOR: 
The priest sat a while as if in deep thought, then entered the names in his book, without making any comments, and the men wrote their signatures underneath.

"The train rolled on, still passing through hamlets occupied by the victorious army. German soldiers could be seen along the roads, on the edges of fields, standing in front of gates or chatting outside cafes. They covered the soil like African locusts.  The officer said, with a wave of his hand:  ""If I had been in command, I'd have taken Paris, burned everything, killed everybody. No more France!""  The Englishman, through politeness, replied simply:  ""Ah! yes.""  He went on:  ""In twenty years all Europe, all of it, will belong to us. Prussia is more than a match for all of them.""  The Englishmen, getting uneasy, no longer replied. Their faces, which had become impassive, seemed made of wax behind their long whiskers. Then the Prussian officer began to laugh. And still, lolling back, he began to sneer. He sneered at the downfall of France, insulted the prostrate enemy; he sneered at Austria, which had been recently conquered; he sneered at the valiant but fruitless defence of the departments; he sneered at the Garde Mobile and at the useless artillery. He announced that Bismarck was going to build a city of iron with the captured cannon. And suddenly he placed his boots against the thigh of M. Dubuis, who turned away his eyes, reddening to the roots of his hair.  The Englishmen seemed to have become indifferent to all that was going on, as if they were suddenly shut up in their own island, far from the din of the world.  The officer took out his pipe, and looking fixedly at the Frenchman, said:  ""You haven't any tobacco--have you?""  M. Dubuis replied:  ""No, monsieur.""  The German resumed:  ""You might go and buy some for me when the train stops.""  And he began laughing afresh as he added:  ""I'll give you the price of a drink.""  The train whistled, and slackened its pace. They passed a station that had been burned down; and then they stopped altogether.  The German opened the carriage door, and, catching M. Dubuis by the arm, said:  ""Go and do what I told you--quick, quick!""  A Prussian detachment occupied the station. Other soldiers were standing behind wooden gratings, looking on. The engine was getting up steam before starting off again. Then M. Dubuis hurriedly jumped on the platform, and, in spite of the warnings of the station master, dashed into the adjoining compartment.

"One glance over the crumbling wall at the edge was generally sufficient for a visitor of even the strongest nerves. There was a sheer drop of more than a mile straight down, and at the distant bottom were jagged rocks and stunted trees that looked, in the blue haze, like shrubbery.  ""This is the spot,"" said the man to himself, ""and to-morrow morning is the time.""  John Bodman had planned his crime as grimly and relentlessly, and as coolly, as ever he had concocted a deal on the Stock Exchange. There was no thought in his mind of mercy for his unconscious victim. His hatred had carried him far.  The next morning after breakfast, he said to his wife: ""I intend to take a walk in the mountains. Do you wish to come with me?""  ""Yes,"" she answered briefly.  ""Very well, then,"" he said; ""I shall be ready at nine o'clock.""  ""I shall be ready at nine o'clock,"" she repeated after him.  At that hour they left the hotel together, to which he was shortly to return alone. They spoke no word to each other on their way to the Hanging Outlook. The path was practically level, skirting the mountains, for the Hanging Outlook was not much higher above the sea than the hotel.  John Bodman had formed no fixed plan for his procedure when the place was reached. He resolved to be guided by circumstances. Now and then a strange fear arose in his mind that she might cling to him and possibly drag him over the precipice with her. He found himself wondering whether she had any premonition of her fate, and one of his reasons for not speaking was the fear that a tremor in his voice might possibly arouse her suspicions. He resolved that his action should be sharp and sudden, that she might have no chance either to help herself or to drag him with her. Of her screams in that desolate region he had no fear. No one could reach the spot except from the hotel, and no one that morning had left the house, even for an expedition to the glacier--one of the easiest and most popular trips from the place.  Curiously enough, when they came within sight of the Hanging Outlook, Mrs. Bodman stopped and shuddered.

This is the spot.

JOHN BODMAN: 
And tomorrow morning is the time.

NARRATOR: 
John Bodman had planned his crime with the same precision and coldness as he did his stock market deals. His hatred for his victim was consuming and had driven him to this point. As they walked towards the Hanging Outlook, his mind was consumed with thoughts of her fate. He wondered if she had any inkling of what was to come.

As they approached the edge, Mrs. Bodman's shudder revealed a hint of fear, but her determination to see the plan through remained unshaken. She was a woman of steel, with a heart as cold as the jagged rocks below.

"Vivienne was about twenty-one. She was of the purest Saxon type. Her hair was a ruddy golden, each filament of the neatly gathered mass shining with its own lustre and delicate graduation of colour. In perfect harmony were her ivory-clear complexion and deep sea-blue eyes that looked upon the world with the ingenuous calmness of a mermaid or the pixie of an undiscovered mountain stream. Her frame was strong and yet possessed the grace of absolute naturalness. And yet with all her Northern clearness and frankness of line and colouring, there seemed to be something of the tropics in her -- something of languor in the droop of her pose, of love of ease in her ingenious complacency of satisfaction and comfort in the mere act of breathing -- something that seemed to claim for her a right as a perfect work of nature to exist and be admired equally with a rare flower or some beautiful, milk-white dove among its sober-hued companions.  She was dressed in a white waist and dark skirt -- that discreet masquerade of goose-girl and duchess.  ""Vivienne,"" said Hartley, looking at her pleadingly, ""you did not answer my last letter. It was only by nearly a week's search that I found where you had moved to. Why have you kept me in suspense when you knew how anxiously I was waiting to see you and hear from you?""  The girl looked out the window dreamily.  ""Mr. Hartley,"" she said hesitatingly, ""I hardly know what to say to you. I realize all the advantages of your offer, and sometimes I feel sure that I could be contented with you. But, again, I am doubtful. I was born a city girl, and I am afraid to bind myself to a quiet suburban life.""  ""My dear girl,"" said Hartley, ardently, ""have I not told you that you shall have everything that your heart can desire that is in my power to give you? You shall come to the city for the theatres, for shopping and to visit your friends as often as you care to. You can trust me, can you not?""  ""To the fullest,"" she said, turning her frank eyes upon him with a smile. ""I know you are the kindest of men, and that the girl you get will be a lucky one. I learned all about you when I was at the Montgomerys'.""  ""Ah!"" exclaimed Hartley, with a tender, reminiscent light in his eye; ""I remember well the evening I first saw you at the Montgomerys'. Mrs. Montgomery was sounding your praises to me all the evening. And she hardly did you justice. I shall never forget that supper. Come, Vivienne, promise me. I want you. You'll never regret coming with me. No one else will ever give you as pleasant a home.""  The girl sighed and looked down at her folded hands.

"Who and where was Miggles? The Judge, our authority, did not remember the name, and he knew the country thoroughly. The Washoe traveler thought Miggles must keep a hotel. We only knew that we were stopped by high water in front and rear, and that Miggles was our rock of refuge. A ten minutes splashing through a tangled by- road, scarcely wide enough for the stage, and we drew up before a barred and boarded gate in a wide stone wall or fence about eight feet high. Evidently Miggles's, and evidently Miggles did not keep a hotel.  The driver got down and tried the gate. It was securely locked. Miggles! O Miggles!""  No answer.  ""Migg-ells! You Miggles!"" continued the driver, with rising wrath.  ""Migglesy!"" joined the expressman, persuasively. ""O Miggy! Mig!""  But no reply came from the apparently insensate Miggles. The Judge, who had finally got the window down, put his head out and propounded a series of questions, which if answered categorically would have undoubtedly elucidated the whole mystery, but which the driver evaded by replying that ""if we didn't want to sit in the coach all night, we had better rise up and sing out for Miggles.""  So we rose up and called on Miggles in chorus; then separately. And when we had finished, a Hibernian fellow-passenger from the roof called for ""Maygells!"" whereat we all laughed. While we were laughing, the driver cried ""Shoo!""  We listened. To our infinite amazement the chorus of ""Miggles"" was repeated from the other side of the wall, even to the final and supplemental ""Maygells.""  ""Extraordinary echo,"" said the Judge.  ""Extraordinary damned skunk!"" roared the driver, contemptuously. ""Come out of that, Miggles, and show yourself! Be a man, Miggles! Don't hide in the dark; I wouldn't if I were you, Miggles,"" continued Yuba Bill, now dancing about in an excess of fury.  ""Miggles!"" continued the voice. ""O Miggles!""  ""My good man!

The travelers stood before the high stone wall, their voices echoing in the stillness of the night. Miggles, the mysterious figure they sought, remained hidden behind the locked gate. The driver's anger rose as he called out for Miggles, his voice bouncing off the walls. The Judge, his head out the window, tried to reason with the unseen figure, but was met with laughter. Yuba Bill, fueled by fury, demanded Miggles to show himself. But all they received in response were more echoes and laughter, taunting them from the darkness. The travelers were left with only questions and a growing sense of unease.

V.O. (Washoe Traveler) Curious, I wonder what kind of person would go by the name Miggles. Is it a nickname or their real name? Either way, they seem to be playing games with us. I can't help but feel a sense of unease in this eerie silence.

The Washoe traveler led the group through a hidden path that led to a small door in the stone wall. They cautiously approached the door and knocked, hoping for a response.

(impatiently) 
Come on, Miggles! Open up!

MIGGLES: 
(suddenly serious) 
Who goes there?

V.O. (Miggles) Miggles, who are these travelers and why do they seek me? I must remain hidden, for my secrets cannot be revealed. Their voices are like daggers, piercing the stillness of the night. The Judge's pleas fall on deaf ears, for I am in control. Let them wonder, let them fear.

(pleading) 
We are travelers in need of shelter. Please, Miggles, open the door.

MIGGLES: 
(after a moment of silence) 
Very well. But you must promise not to reveal my secret to anyone.

V.O. (Miggles) After a moment of silence, Miggles couldn't help but feel a twinge of guilt for keeping his secret hidden. But he couldn't risk it being exposed. The travelers' anger only fueled his fear. What if they found out? What would they do? He had to stay hidden, no matter the cost.

EXPRESSMAN: 
(excitedly) 
We promise! Now please, let us in.

The door creaked open and the travelers were greeted by Miggles, a mysterious figure cloaked in shadows. She led them inside her home, a grand mansion filled with secrets and wonders.

That, my dear Judge, is a secret I will never reveal.

But why did you hide from us? We only wanted shelter from the storm.

MIGGLES: 
(sadly) 
I have been hurt by many in the past. I have learned to trust no one but myself.

YUBA BILL: 
(apologetically) 
We are sorry for intruding, Miggles. We will leave you in peace.

MIGGLES: 
(smiling) 
No need to apologize, my friends. You are welcome to stay as long as you like.

V.O. (Miggles) Miggles watched the travelers with amusement, their frustration palpable. It was always entertaining to see how easily humans could be riled up. But they seemed harmless enough, and their voices echoed beautifully against the stone walls. Perhaps I'll let them stay a little longer.

NARRATOR: 
And so, the travelers stayed with Miggles, learning more about her mysterious past and the secrets that lay within her home. They left with a newfound respect for the enigmatic woman, and a promise to keep her secrets safe. Miggles remained a mystery, but she was no longer a figure to be feared. She had become a friend.

"Corley's stride acknowledged the compliment. The swing of his burly body made his friend execute a few light skips from the path to the roadway and back again. Corley was the son of an inspector of police and he had inherited his father's frame and gut. He walked with his hands by his sides, holding himself erect and swaying his head from side to side. His head was large, globular and oily; it sweated in all weathers; and his large round hat, set upon it sideways, looked like a bulb which had grown out of another. He always stared straight before him as if he were on parade and, when he wished to gaze after someone in the street, it was necessary for him to move his body from the hips. At present he was about town. Whenever any job was vacant a friend was always ready to give him the hard word. He was often to be seen walking with policemen in plain clothes, talking earnestly. He knew the inner side of all affairs and was fond of delivering final judgments. He spoke without listening to the speech of his companions. His conversation was mainly about himself what he had said to such a person and what such a person had said to him and what he had said to settle the matter. When he reported these dialogues he aspirated the first letter of his name after the manner of Florentines.  Lenehan offered his friend a cigarette. As the two young men walked on through the crowd Corley occasionally turned to smile at some of the passing girls but Lenehan's gaze was fixed on the large faint moon circled with a double halo. He watched earnestly the passing of the grey web of twilight across its face. At length he said:  ""Well... tell me, Corley, I suppose you'll be able to pull it off all right, eh?""  Corley closed one eye expressively as an answer.  ""Is she game for that?"" asked Lenehan dubiously. ""You can never know women.""  ""She's all right,"" said Corley. ""I know the way to get around her, man. She's a bit gone on me.""  ""You're what I call a gay Lothario,"" said Lenehan. ""And the proper kind of a Lothario, too!""  A shade of mockery relieved the servility of his manner. To save himself he had the habit of leaving his flattery open to the interpretation of raillery. But Corley had not a subtle mind.  ""There's nothing to touch a good slavey,"" he affirmed. ""Take my tip for it."" ",fiction,serious,"Corley, Lenehan, Harpist","LENEHAN:

So, what's the plan for tonight?

She watched as Corley flaunted his confidence, and couldn't help but feel a twinge of envy. ""But I don't need to play their game. I have my music.""

LENEHAN: 
(jokingly) 
Just admiring our dear friend Corley here and his way with the ladies.

V.O. (Lenehan) ""Ha, Corley always knows how to work his charm. But I can't help but wonder if his confidence is just a facade. He's always so sure of himself, while I'm left trailing behind. Maybe I should take some notes from him. But then again, I'm not sure I want to be like him.""

HARPIST: 
(smiling) 
Ah, yes. Corley is quite the charmer. But don't sell yourself short, Lenehan. You've got your own way with the ladies.

V.O. (Harpist) HARPIST: (smiling) Corley's charm is undeniable, but I have my own way with the ladies. Lenehan may doubt our plan, but I know my past successes will lead us to victory. Corley's confidence is infectious, and I can't help but admire his charisma.

LENEHAN:

That's right. I'm the king of romance.

"Men climbed the trunks, everywhere shaking the laden branches and hitting them with long bamboo poles to knock the fruit off, while women and children, squatting on their haunches, spent laborious hours filling baskets underneath, then loading mules and donkeys with their daily ""catch."" But an olive to eat was unobtainable. He had never cared for olives, but now he craved with all his soul to feel his teeth in one.  ""Ach! But it is the Spanish olive that you eat,"" explained the head waiter, a German ""from Basel."" ""These are for oil only."" After which he disliked the olive more than ever--until that night when he saw the first eatable specimen rolling across the shiny parquet floor, propelled towards him by the careless hand of a pretty girl, who then looked up into his eyes and smiled.  He was convinced that Eve, similarly, had rolled the apple towards Adam across the emerald sward of the first garden in the world.  He slept usually like the dead. It must have been something very real that made him open his eyes and sit up in bed alertly. There was a noise against his door. He listened. The room was still quite dark. It was early morning. The noise was not repeated.  ""Who's there?"" he asked in a sleepy whisper. ""What is it?""  The noise came again. Some one was scratching on the door. No, it was somebody tapping.  ""What do you want?"" he demanded in a louder voice. ""Come in,"" he added, wondering sleepily whether he was presentable. Either the hotel was on fire or the porter was waking the wrong person for some sunrise expedition.  Nothing happened. Wide awake now, he turned the switch on, but no light flooded the room. The electricians, he remembered with a curse, were out on strike. He fumbled for the matches, and as he did so a voice in the corridor became distinctly audible. It was just outside his door.  ""Aren't you ready?"" he heard. ""You sleep for ever.""  And the voice, although never having heard it before, he could not have recognised it, belonged, he knew suddenly, to the girl who had let the olive fall. In an instant he was out of bed. He lit a candle.  ""I'm coming,"" he called softly, as he slipped rapidly into some clothes. ""I'm sorry I've kept you. I shan't be a minute.""  ""Be quick then!"" he heard, while the candle flame slowly grew, and he found his garments. Less than three minutes later he opened the door and, candle in hand, peered into the dark passage.  ""Blow it out!"" came a peremptory whisper. He obeyed, but not quick enough. A pair of red lips emerged from the shadows. There was a puff, and the candle was extinguished.

He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you.""

For still higher sums, he laid the symbols on the log of driftwood; and for symbols he was hard put, being compelled to use the teeth from the skulls for millions, and the crab-shells for billions. It was here that he stopped, for the boys were showing signs of becoming tired. ""There were four million people in San Francisco—four teeth."" The boys' eyes ranged along from the teeth and from hand to hand, down through the pebbles and sand-grains to Edwin's fingers. And back again they ranged along the ascending series in the effort to grasp such inconceivable numbers. ""That was a lot of folks, Granser,"" Edwin at last hazarded. ""Like sand on the beach here, like sand on the beach, each grain of sand a man, or woman, or child. Yes, my boy, all those people lived right here in San Francisco. And at one time or another all those people came out on this very beach—more people than there are grains of sand. More—more—more. And San Francisco was a noble city. And across the bay—where we camped last year, even more people lived, clear from Point Richmond, on the level ground and on the hills, all the way around to San Leandro—one great city of seven million people.—Seven teeth... there, that's it, seven millions.""

Well, my boy, let me show you. Hoo-Hoo, hold up your two hands.

Now, that grain of sand represents your ten fingers and thumbs. And this one is another ten. And this one, and this one...

Yes, and each one represents ten fingers. So, if we add ten grains of sand, we have one hundred fingers. Remember that number, one hundred.

Well, let's see. If we use the log to represent one million fingers, how many teeth do you think we'll need?

(nods) 
Exactly! Seven teeth for one million fingers. And remember, there were four million people living in San Francisco alone. That's four teeth.

EDWIN: 
(trying to imagine) 
Wow, that's a lot of people.

GRANSER: 
(nods) 
Yes, and that's just one city. Across the bay, there were even more people. Seven million, to be exact.

Yes, my boy. More than all the sand on this beach. And all those people lived right here, in this very spot.

GRANSER:

They're gone, my boy. But we must remember them, and the great city they once lived in. And we must never forget the importance of numbers and counting, for they help us understand the world and its history.

"We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes. ""You are not very vulnerable from above,"" Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him. ""Nor from below,"" said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. ""Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!"" he remarked, looking up in surprise. ""I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!"" said Holmes severely. ""You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?"" The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket. ""We have at least an hour before us,"" he remarked, ""for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor—as no doubt you have divined—in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present."" ""It is our French gold,"" whispered the director. ""We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it."" ""Your French gold?"" ""Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar.""",mystery,suspenseful," Sherlock Holmes, Mr. Merryweather, Dr. Watson","NARRATOR: 
The air in the cellar is thick and musty, the scent of earth and old wood filling our nostrils as we follow Mr. Merryweather down the winding stone steps. The sound of our footsteps echoes off the walls, the only noise in the otherwise silent space.

(Calmly) 
Do not worry, Mr. Merryweather. We have at least an hour before they can make their escape.

Holmes nods in agreement and continues to search for any clues that may lead them to the culprits. Suddenly, he stops and kneels down, examining something on the floor.

SHERLOCK HOLMES: 
(Excitedly) 
I have found something. A piece of fabric from the criminal's clothing.

SHERLOCK HOLMES: 
(Smiling) 
Elementary, my dear Watson. The fabric is a rare silk, only found in the most expensive shops in Paris. It can only mean one thing - the criminals are French.

The trio continues to search the cellar, following the trail of clues left behind by the criminals. As they approach the end of the vault, they hear a noise coming from behind a large crate.

I must say, you have quite the elaborate plan to steal the French gold. But unfortunately for you, it has been foiled.

SHERLOCK HOLMES: 
(Smiling) 
The fabric from your clothing gave you away. And your French accents were a dead giveaway.

The criminals are arrested, and the French gold is safely returned to the bank. Mr. Merryweather is relieved and grateful to Holmes and Watson for their quick thinking and detective skills.

It was all in a day's work, Mr. Merryweather. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have another case to solve.

He struggled to keep up, but his legs felt like stone. “Wait,” he begged. “Please . . .” As he climbed, his vision began to blur. There was a thundering in his ears. I must reach her! But when he looked up again, the woman had disappeared. In her place stood an old man with rotting teeth. The man stared down, curling his lips into a lonely grimace.

You’ve written three books on symbology and—” “Do you know what time it is?” “I apologize. I have something you need to see. I can’t discuss it on the phone.”A knowing groan escaped Langdon’s lips. This had happened before. One of the perils of writing books about religious symbology was the calls from religious zealots who wanted him to confirm their latest sign from God. Last month a stripper from Oklahoma had promised Langdon the best sex of his life if he would fly down and verify the authenticity of a cruciform that had magically appeared on her bed sheets. The Shroud of Tulsa, Langdon had called it. “How did you get my number?” Langdon tried to be polite, despite the hour. “On the Worldwide Web. The site for your book.” Langdon frowned.

"Hundreds of miles from CERN, a voice crackled through a walkie-talkie. “Okay, I’m in the hallway.” The technician monitoring the video screens pressed the button on his transmitter. “You’re looking for camera #86. It’s supposed to be at the far end.” There was a long silence on the radio. The waiting technician broke a light sweat. Finally his radio clicked. “The camera isn’t here,” the voice said. “I can see where it was mounted, though. Somebody must have removed it.” The technician exhaled heavily. “Thanks. Hold on a second, will you?” Sighing, he redirected his attention to the bank of video screens in front of him. Huge portions of the complex were open to the public, and wireless cameras had gone missing before, usually stolen by visiting pranksters looking for souvenirs. But as soon as a camera left the facility and was out of range, the signal was lost, and the screen went blank. Perplexed, the technician gazed up at the monitor. A crystal clear image was still coming from camera #86. If the camera was stolen, he wondered, why are we still getting a signal? He knew, of course, there was only one explanation. The camera was still inside the complex, and someone had simply moved it. But who? And why? He studied the monitor a long moment. Finally he picked up his walkietalkie. “Are there any closets in that stairwell? Any cupboards or dark alcoves?” The voice replying sounded confused. “No. Why?” The technician frowned. “Never mind. Thanks for your help.” He turned off his walkie-talkie and pursed his lips. Considering the small size of the video camera and the fact that it was wireless, the technician knew that camera #86 could be transmitting from just about anywhere within the heavily guarded compound—a densely packed collection of thirty-two separate buildings covering a half-mile radius. The only clue was that the camera seemed to have been placed somewhere dark. Of course, that wasn’t much help. The complex contained endless dark locations —maintenance closets, heating ducts, gardening sheds, bedroom wardrobes, even a labyrinth of underground tunnels. Camera #86 could take weeks to locate. But that’s the least of my problems, he thought. Despite the dilemma posed by the camera’s relocation, there was another far more unsettling matter at hand.

"Do I have your attention now?” the man’s voice said when Langdon finally answered the line. “Yes, sir, you damn well do. You want to explain yourself?” “I tried to tell you before.” The voice was rigid, mechanical. “I’m a physicist. I run a research facility. We’ve had a murder. You saw the body.” “How did you find me?” Langdon could barely focus. His mind was racing from the image on the fax. “I already told you. The Worldwide Web. The site for your book, The Art of the Illuminati.” Langdon tried to gather his thoughts. His book was virtually unknown in mainstream literary circles, but it had developed quite a following on-line. Nonetheless, the caller’s claim still made no sense. “That page has no contact information,” Langdon challenged. “I’m certain of it.” “I have people here at the lab very adept at extracting user information from the Web.” Langdon was skeptical. “Sounds like your lab knows a lot about the Web.” “We should,” the man fired back. “We invented it.” Something in the man’s voice told Langdon he was not joking. “I must see you,” the caller insisted. “This is not a matter we can discuss on the phone. My lab is only an hour’s flight from Boston.” Langdon stood in the dim light of his study and analyzed the fax in his hand. The image was overpowering, possibly representing the epigraphical find of the century, a decade of his research confirmed in a single symbol. “It’s urgent,” the voice pressured. Langdon’s eyes were locked on the brand. Illuminati, he read over and over. His work had always been based on the symbolic equivalent of fossils—ancient documents and historical hearsay—but this image before him was today. Present tense. He felt like a paleontologist coming face to face with a living dinosaur. “I’ve taken the liberty of sending a plane for you,” the voice said. “It will be in Boston in twenty minutes.” Langdon felt his mouth go dry. An hour’s flight . . . “Please forgive my presumption,” the voice said. “I need you here.” Langdon looked again at the fax—an ancient myth confirmed in black and white. The implications were frightening. He gazed absently through the bay window. The first hint of dawn was sifting through the birch trees in his backyard, but the view looked somehow different this morning.

And yet, the possibility of the Illuminati still being active, of them silencing Leonardo to prevent his message of unity from reaching the masses, lingered in the back of his mind.

LANGDON: 
(curious) 
But aren't scientists today a bit less defensive about the church?

KOHLER: 
(grunting in disgust) 
Why should we be? The church may not be burning scientists at the stake anymore, but if you think they've released their reign over science, ask yourself why half the schools in your country are not allowed to teach evolution. Ask yourself why the U.S. Christian Coalition is the most influential lobby against scientific progress in the world.

The battle between science and religion is still raging, Mr. Kohler.

NARRATOR: 
The CERN laboratory was a hub of activity, with scientists scurrying about, their eyes glued to their computer screens. The air was thick with tension, as if the very secrets of the universe were being unraveled before their eyes. Kohler's voice cut through the silence, his words heavy with gravity. Langdon felt his heart race as he listened to the groundbreaking research being discussed. The smell of coffee lingered in the air, a reminder of the long hours these scientists spent in pursuit of knowledge. The room was filled with the hum of machines and the occasional beep of a computer. Langdon couldn't help but feel a sense of awe and disconcertion at the thought of the molecules in his body being intertwined with those of the people around him. The power of God, the forces that bind us all, it was all too much to take in. And yet, the possibility of the Illuminati still being active, of them silencing Leonardo to prevent his message of unity from reaching the masses, lingered in the back of Langdon's mind.

"Not many children could say they remembered the day they met their father, but Vittoria Vetra could. She was eight years old, living where she always had, Orfanotrofio di Siena, a Catholic orphanage near Florence, deserted by parents she never knew. It was raining that day. The nuns had called for her twice to come to dinner, but as always she pretended not to hear. She lay outside in the courtyard, staring up at the raindrops . . . feeling them hit her body . . . trying to guess where one would land next. The nuns called again, threatening that pneumonia might make an insufferably headstrong child a lot less curious about nature. I can’t hear you, Vittoria thought. She was soaked to the bone when the young priest came out to get her. She didn’t know him. He was new there. Vittoria waited for him to grab her and drag her back inside. But he didn’t. Instead, to her wonder, he lay down beside her, soaking his robes in a puddle. “They say you ask a lot of questions,” the young man said. Vittoria scowled. “Are questions bad?” He laughed. “Guess they were right.” “What are you doing out here?” “Same thing you’re doing . . . wondering why raindrops fall.” “I’m not wondering why they fall! I already know!” The priest gave her an astonished look. “You do?” “Sister Francisca says raindrops are angels’ tears coming down to wash away our sins.” “Wow!” he said, sounding amazed. “So that explains it.” “No it doesn’t!” the girl fired back. “Raindrops fall because everything falls! Everything falls! Not just rain!” The priest scratched his head, looking perplexed. “You know, young lady, you’re right. Everything does fall. It must be gravity.” “It must be what?” He gave her an astonished look. “You haven’t heard of gravity?” “No.” The priest shrugged sadly. “Too bad. Gravity answers a lot of questions.” Vittoria sat up. “What’s gravity?” she demanded. “Tell me!” The priest gave her a wink. “What do you say I tell you over dinner.” The young priest was Leonardo Vetra. Although he had been an awardwinning physics student while in university, he’d heard another call and gone into the seminary. Leonardo and Vittoria became unlikely best friends in the lonely world of nuns and regulations.

"Phileas Fogg rightly suspected that his departure from London would create a lively sensation at the West End. The news of the bet spread through the Reform Club, and afforded an exciting topic of conversation to its members. From the club it soon got into the papers throughout England. The boasted ""tour of the world"" was talked about, disputed, argued with as much warmth as if the subject were another Alabama claim. Some took sides with Phileas Fogg, but the large majority shook their heads and declared against him; it was absurd, impossible, they declared, that the tour of the world could be made, except theoretically and on paper, in this minimum of time, and with the existing means of travelling. The Times, Standard, Morning Post, and Daily News, and twenty other highly respectable newspapers scouted Mr. Fogg's project as madness; the Daily Telegraph alone hesitatingly supported him. People in general thought him a lunatic, and blamed his Reform Club friends for having accepted a wager which betrayed the mental aberration of its proposer.  Articles no less passionate than logical appeared on the question, for geography is one of the pet subjects of the English; and the columns devoted to Phileas Fogg's venture were eagerly devoured by all classes of readers. At first some rash individuals, principally of the gentler sex, espoused his cause, which became still more popular when the Illustrated London News came out with his portrait, copied from a photograph in the Reform Club. A few readers of the Daily Telegraph even dared to say, ""Why not, after all? Stranger things have come to pass.""  At last a long article appeared, on the 7th of October, in the bulletin of the Royal Geographical Society, which treated the question from every point of view, and demonstrated the utter folly of the enterprise.  Everything, it said, was against the travellers, every obstacle imposed alike by man and by nature. A miraculous agreement of the times of departure and arrival, which was impossible, was absolutely necessary to his success. He might, perhaps, reckon on the arrival of trains at the designated hours, in Europe, where the distances were relatively moderate; but when he calculated upon crossing India in three days, and the United States in seven, could he rely beyond misgiving upon accomplishing his task?

The atmosphere in the Reform Club was tense as the news of Phileas Fogg's departure from London spread like wildfire. Excited murmurs and heated discussions filled the air, with some members supporting Fogg's bold bet while others dismissed it as sheer madness. The newspapers were no less passionate, with articles both logical and emotional appearing daily. The English, known for their love of geography, eagerly devoured every word written about Fogg's daring venture. Even the Illustrated London News featured his portrait, further fueling the public's fascination. But as the Royal Geographical Society's bulletin pointed out, every obstacle, both man-made and natural, stood in Fogg's way. Could he truly succeed against such impossible odds?

PHILEAS FOGG: 
(steadfast and determined) 
I assure you, gentlemen, my plan is not madness. I have carefully calculated every detail and I am confident that I can travel around the world in just 80 days.

V.O. (Phileas Fogg) I can feel their eyes on me, questioning my sanity. But I will not falter. I have planned every step, every minute detail. I will prove them wrong and show the world what I am capable of. The odds may be against me, but I am determined to succeed.

You cannot be serious. This is a foolish and futile endeavor. And I blame his friends for accepting such a wager.

Some thought him a lunatic, others a hero. The news of Phileas Fogg's bet spread like wildfire, with everyone having an opinion on the matter. But as the debate raged on, one thing was certain: this would be a journey like no other.

V.O. (General Public) Wow, what a bold move. Some say he's crazy, others say he's a hero. I can't help but feel a mix of emotions. This journey will be like no other, that's for sure. But can he really do it? Against all odds? I can't wait to find out.

"Presently we saw that the cavern before us opened upon a hazy void. In another moment we had emerged upon a sort of slanting gallery, that projected into a vast circular space, a huge cylindrical pit running vertically up and down. Round this pit the slanting gallery ran without any parapet or protection for a turn and a half, and then plunged high above into the rock again. Somehow it reminded me then one of those spiral turns of the railway through the Saint Gothard. It was all tremendously huge. I can scarcely hope to convey to you the Titanic proportion of all that place, the Titanic effect of it. Our eyes followed up the vast declivity of the pit wall, and overhead and far above we beheld a round opening set with faint stars, and half of the lip about it well nigh blinding with the white light of the sun. At that we cried aloud simultaneously.  ""Come on!"" I said, leading the way.  ""But there?"" said Cavor, and very carefully stepped nearer the edge of the gallery. I followed his example, and craned forward and looked down, but I was dazzled by that gleam of light above, and I could see only a bottomless darkness with spectral patches of crimson and purple floating therein. Yet if I could not see, I could hear. Out of this darkness came a sound, a sound like the angry hum one can hear if one puts one's ear outside a hive of bees, a sound out of that enormous hollow, it may be, four miles beneath our feet...  For a moment I listened, then tightened my grip on my crowbar, and led the way up the gallery.  ""This must be the shaft we looked down upon,"" said Cavor. ""Under that lid.""  ""And below there, is where we saw the lights.""  ""The lights!"" said he. ""Yes--the lights of the world that now we shall never see.""  ""We'll come back,"" I said, for now we had escaped so much I was rashly sanguine that we should recover the sphere.  His answer I did not catch.  ""Eh?"" I asked.  ""It doesn't matter,"" he answered, and we hurried on in silence.  I suppose that slanting lateral way was four or five miles long, allowing for its curvature, and it ascended at a slope that would have made it almost impossibly steep on earth, but which one strode up easily under lunar conditions. We saw only two Selenites during all that portion of our flight, and directly they became aware of us they ran headlong. ",fiction,mysterious,"Narrator, Cavor, Selenites","NARRATOR:

The absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at once. Then he turned to the two others who were following him and spoke to them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue.  ""There were others coming, and presently a little group of perhaps eight or ten of these exquisite creatures were about me. One of them addressed me. It came into my head, oddly enough, that my voice was too harsh and deep for them. So I shook my head, and, pointing to my ears, shook it again. He came a step forward, hesitated, and then touched my hand. Then I felt other soft little tentacles upon my back and shoulders. They wanted to make sure I was real. There was nothing in this at all alarming. Indeed, there was something in these pretty little people that inspired confidence, a graceful gentleness, a certain childlike ease.

""And then, looking more nearly into their features, I saw some further peculiarities in their Dresden china type of prettiness. Their hair, which was uniformly curly, came to a sharp end at the neck and cheek; there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the face, and their ears were singularly minute. The mouths were small, with bright red, rather thin lips, and the little chins ran to a point.

V.O. (Fragile Beings From The Future) ""Wow, they're so different from us. I can feel their gentle energy, it's almost soothing. I wonder what their world is like. Maybe they can teach us something about peace and harmony. I can't wait to explore and learn from them.""

NARRATOR: 
The protagonist couldn't help but laugh along, the absence of fear in their demeanor putting them at ease.

[SFX : LAUGH]

FRAGILE BEINGS FROM THE FUTURE: 
(smiling) 
Do not be afraid. We mean you no harm.

NARRATOR: 
As they approached, the protagonist noticed their unique features - curly hair that ended abruptly, tiny ears, and small, pointed chins.

FRAGILE BEINGS FROM THE FUTURE: 
(curiously) 
What do you think of us? Are we not beautiful?

NARRATOR: 
But it was their large, mild eyes that caught their attention.

FRAGILE BEINGS FROM THE FUTURE: 
(looking into the protagonist's eyes) 
We see the curiosity in your eyes. You are not like the others who have come before.

NARRATOR: 
Despite their initial curiosity, the creatures seemed uninterested in the protagonist.

FRAGILE BEINGS FROM THE FUTURE: 
(cooing) 
We have seen many travelers like you. But you are different.

NARRATOR: 
Attempting to communicate, the protagonist pointed to the Time Machine and the sun.

FRAGILE BEINGS FROM THE FUTURE: 
(imitating thunder) 
We understand. You come from a different time.

NARRATOR: 
And was met with a surprising imitation of thunder.

FRAGILE BEINGS FROM THE FUTURE: 
(smiling) 
We may not speak your language, but we can communicate in other ways.

NARRATOR: 
The narrator couldn't help but be amused by the creatures' attempts to communicate.

NARRATOR: 
He pointed to himself, trying to convey that he was from a different time.

FRAGILE BEINGS FROM THE FUTURE: 
(curiously) 
You are from the past. How fascinating.

NARRATOR: 
Then hesitating for a moment how to express time, the narrator pointed to the sun.

FRAGILE BEINGS FROM THE FUTURE: 
(understanding) 
Ah, time. It is a concept we are familiar with.

V.O. (Fragile Beings From The Future) ""Ah, time. It is a concept we are familiar with. Understanding it has always been our strength. But these creatures, they seem to have a different understanding of time. Their laughter and carefree nature make me feel at ease. I can't help but wonder what their world is like.""

NARRATOR: 
At once a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and white followed the narrator's gesture, and then astonished him by imitating the sound of thunder.

[SFX : SOUND OF THUNDER]

FRAGILE BEINGS FROM THE FUTURE: 
(smiling) 
We have learned much from travelers like you. But there is still so much we do not know.

NARRATOR: 
The narrator couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder and excitement at the thought of sharing his knowledge with these delicate creatures from the future.

FRAGILE BEINGS FROM THE FUTURE: 
(curiously) 
Will you tell us more about your time?

NARRATOR: 
And so, the narrator spent hours conversing with the fragile beings from the future, sharing stories and knowledge from his time. And in return, they shared their own stories and knowledge, creating a bond between the two worlds that would last for eternity.

You can see the situation. How can we deal with a factor like this? The perfect variable.

Perfect? Prediction should still be possible. A living thing still acts from necessity, the same as inanimate material. But the cause-effect chain is more subtle; there are more factors to be considered. The difference is quantitative, I think.

V.O. (Kramer) Kramer's mind raced as he considered the latest failure. The pseudopodium was an unbeatable weapon, and they were at a standstill. But he had an idea, one that might just work. They needed to scrap their current strategy and find something new. It was their only hope.

Meanwhile the war continues as it is. Stalemate. Checkmate. They can't get to us, and we can't get through their living minefield.

Here's our theory. We keep looking for contact, a trigger in the pseudopodium. But more likely we're witnessing a psychological phenomena, a decision without any physical correlative. We're watching for something that isn't there. The mine decides to blow up. It sees our ship, approaches, and then decides.

Well, that confirms what I'm saying. How can a ship guided by automatic relays escape a mine that decides to explode? The whole theory of mine penetration is that you must avoid tripping the trigger. But here the trigger is a state of mind in a complicated, developed life-form.

NARRATOR: 
Kramer's theory was a breakthrough, but it also brought a new level of complexity to the situation. The war room was filled with the smell of sweat and tension as the team grappled with the enormity of their task. They were facing an enemy that was unlike any they had ever encountered, and it was clear that a new approach was needed if they were ever going to defeat it. The rocket expert's insight had confirmed their suspicions, but it also raised more questions. How could they outsmart a living organism that was constantly evolving and making decisions based on its own complex thought processes? The war raged on, with no end in sight, but the team remained determined to find a solution. They had to, for the sake of their planet and their survival.

"One day Murlock returned from gunning in a distant part of the forest to find his wife prostrate with fever, and delirious. There was no physician within miles, no neighbor; nor was she in a condition to be left, to summon help. So he set about the task of nursing her back to health, but at the end of the third day she fell into unconsciousness arid so passed away, apparently, with never a gleam of returning reason.  From what we know of a nature like his we may venture to sketch in some of the details of the outline picture drawn by my grandfather. When convinced that she was dead, Murlock had sense enough to remember that the dead must be prepared for burial. In performance of this sacred duty he blundered now and again, did certain things incorrectly, and others which he did correctly were done over and over. His occasional failures to accomplish some simple and ordinary act filled him with astonishment, like that of a drunken man who wonders at the suspension of familiar natural laws. He was surprised, too, that he did not weep--surprised and a little ashamed; surely it is unkind not to weep for the dead. ""Tomorrow,"" he said aloud, ""I shall have to make the coffin arid dig the grave; and then I shall miss her, when she is no longer in sight; but now--she is dead, of course, but it is all right--it must be all right, somehow. Things cannot be so bad as they seem.""  He stood over the body in the fading light, adjusting the hair and putting the finishing touches to the simple toilet, doing all mechanically, with soulless care. And still through his consciousness ran an undersense of conviction that all was right--that he should have her again as before, and everything explained. He had had no experience in grief; his capacity had not been enlarged by use. His heart could not contain it all, nor his imagination rightly conceive it. He did not know he was so hard struck; that knowledge would come later, and never go. Grief is an artist of powers as various as the instruments upon which he plays his dirges for the dead, evoking from some the sharpest, shrillest notes, from others the low, grave chords that throb recurrent like the slow beating of a distant drum. Some natures it startles; some it stupefies. ",horror,suspenseful,"Murlock, Murlock's wife","NARRATOR: 
The cabin is dark and silent, save for the occasional rustling of leaves outside. Murlock stands over his wife's lifeless body, the fading light casting eerie shadows on her pale face. He adjusts her hair and finishes dressing her, his movements mechanical and soulless. As he works, a sense of unease washes over him, a feeling that something is not right. He can't shake the feeling that she will return to him, that everything will be explained. But as the night wears on, the truth sinks in and grief takes hold, its sharp notes and low, throbbing chords echoing through the cabin. Murlock is stupefied, unable to comprehend the weight of his loss.

MURLOCK: 
(whispers) 
It's not right. She'll come back to me, won't she?

NARRATOR: 
But there is no answer, only the sound of the wind outside. Murlock's mind is in turmoil, trying to make sense of what has happened.

MURLOCK: 
(voice trembling) 
I did everything I could. I tried to save her. Why did she have to leave me?

NARRATOR: 
He looks down at his wife's lifeless body, tears welling up in his eyes. He can't bring himself to fully accept that she is gone.

MURLOCK: 
(voice breaking) 
I don't understand. How can she be gone? She was here just a few days ago, laughing and talking. How can she just...disappear?

NARRATOR: 
He falls to his knees, his body racked with sobs. He feels a hand on his shoulder and looks up to see his wife's face, her expression serene and peaceful.

NARRATOR: 
Murlock's eyes widen in shock and disbelief. He reaches out to touch her, but his hand passes through her body.

MURLOCK: 
(stunned) 
This can't be real. You're not really here, are you?

NARRATOR: 
Murlock's heart breaks as he realizes that he must say goodbye to his wife. He stands up and looks at her, his eyes filled with sorrow.

MURLOCK: 
(whispers) 
I will always love you. I promise to honor your memory and give you a proper burial.

V.O. (Murlock) I can't believe she's gone. I'll never see her smile again, hear her laugh, feel her warmth. How can I go on without her? But I promised to honor her memory, to give her a proper burial. I'll keep that promise, even if it's the last thing I do.

NARRATOR: 
With a heavy heart, he begins to prepare her body for burial. As he works, he can't help but feel a sense of peace, knowing that his wife is still with him in some way.

MURLOCK: 
(voice trembling) 
I will miss you, my love. But I know that you are in a better place now.

V.O. (Murlock) I can't believe she's gone. I'll never see her smile again or feel her warmth. But I have to keep going, for her. Maybe she'll come back, maybe there's still hope. But as the night grows darker, I know it's just wishful thinking. The emptiness consumes me.

NARRATOR: 
As the night wears on, Murlock finishes his task and sits by his wife's body, lost in thought. He is startled when he hears a voice behind him.

NEIGHBOR: 
(shocked) 
Murlock! What happened? I saw the light in your cabin and thought I'd check on you.

MURLOCK: 
(voice shaking) 
My wife...she's gone.

V.O. (Murlock) My wife...she's gone. Her breath, her warmth, her laughter...all gone. How can I go on without her? I can't believe she's really gone. Maybe if I just keep working, keep pretending, she'll come back. But deep down, I know the truth. She's never coming back. My heart is shattered, my soul is empty. I am lost without her.

NEIGHBOR: 
(puts a hand on Murlock's shoulder) 
I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do to help?

MURLOCK: 
(looks at his wife's body) 
No, thank you. I promised her I would take care of everything.

NEIGHBOR: 
(nods) 
I understand. I'll leave you to it then. But if you need anything, don't hesitate to ask.

NARRATOR: 
The neighbor leaves and Murlock is left alone with his thoughts. He looks at his wife's peaceful face and smiles through his tears.

MURLOCK: 
(whispers) 
Goodbye, my love. I will always remember you.

NARRATOR: 
As the night turns into day, Murlock finishes digging the grave and placing his wife's body inside. He looks up at the sky, the first rays of sunlight breaking through the trees.

MURLOCK: 
(voice trembling) 
I will always love you, my dear. Rest in peace.

NARRATOR: 
And with that, Murlock walks away from the grave, his heart heavy but at peace. He knows that his wife will always be with him, watching over him from above.

"Every Sunday he met in this very spot Monsieur Sauvage, a stout, jolly, little man, a draper in the Rue Notre Dame de Lorette, and also an ardent fisherman. They often spent half the day side by side, rod in hand and feet dangling over the water, and a warm friendship had sprung up between the two.  Some days they did not speak; at other times they chatted; but they understood each other perfectly without the aid of words, having similar tastes and feelings.  In the spring, about ten o'clock in the morning, when the early sun caused a light mist to float on the water and gently warmed the backs of the two enthusiastic anglers, Morissot would occasionally remark to his neighbor:  ""My, but it's pleasant here.""  To which the other would reply:  ""I can't imagine anything better!""  And these few words sufficed to make them understand and appreciate each other.  In the autumn, toward the close of day, when the setting sun shed a blood-red glow over the western sky, and the reflection of the crimson clouds tinged the whole river with red, brought a glow to the faces of the two friends, and gilded the trees, whose leaves were already turning at the first chill touch of winter, Monsieur Sauvage would sometimes smile at Morissot, and say:  ""What a glorious spectacle!""  And Morissot would answer, without taking his eyes from his float:  ""This is much better than the boulevard, isn't it?""  As soon as they recognized each other they shook hands cordially, affected at the thought of meeting under such changed circumstances.  Monsieur Sauvage, with a sigh, murmured:  ""These are sad times!""  Morissot shook his head mournfully.  ""And such weather! This is the first fine day of the year.""  The sky was, in fact, of a bright, cloudless blue.",fiction,serious,"Morissot, Monsieur Sauvage","MORISSOT:

"She tried to speak to the little quadroon boy; but no sound would come, at first. When he heard his name uttered, he looked up, and his mistress was pointing to the door. He laid aside the great, soft fan, and obediently stole away, over the polished floor, on his bare tiptoes. She stayed motionless, with gaze riveted upon her child, and her face the picture of fright. Presently her husband entered the room, and without noticing her, went to a table and began to search among some papers which covered it. ""Armand,"" she called to him, in a voice which must have stabbed him, if he was human. But he did not notice. ""Armand,"" she said again. Then she rose and tottered towards him. ""Armand,"" she panted once more, clutching his arm, ""look at our child. What does it mean? Tell me."" He coldly but gently loosened her fingers from about his arm and thrust the hand away from him. ""Tell me what it means!"" she cried despairingly. ""It means,"" he answered lightly, ""that the child is not white; it means that you are not white.""

V.O. (The Cook) The cook's mind raced as he gazed at the distant house of refuge. He couldn't shake off the feeling of unease, knowing that their fate rested on the strangers in the boat. He prayed that they would be rescued soon, but his heart still clenched with fear.

THE CORRESPONDENT: 
(curious) 
As soon as who see us?

THE COOK: 
(assured) 
The crew.

THE CORRESPONDENT: 
(doubtful) 
Houses of refuge don't have crews.

THE COOK: 
(explaining) 
As I understand them, they are only places where clothes and grub are stored for the benefit of shipwrecked people. They don't carry crews.

THE CORRESPONDENT: 
(dismissive) 
Oh, yes, they do.

THE COOK: 
(defensive) 
No, they don't.

THE OILER: 
(reminding) 
We're not there yet, anyhow.

THE COOK: 
(uncertain) 
Well, perhaps it's not a house of refuge that I'm thinking of as being near Mosquito Inlet Light. Perhaps it's a life-saving station.

THE OILER: 
(reminding) 
We're not there yet.

NARRATOR: 
The men continued their debate, their voices growing more tense as they struggled to understand their situation. But in the end, it didn't matter. All that mattered was that they were not there yet, and they still had a chance to be rescued. The sun rose steadily in the sky, casting a warm light over the men in the boat. The sea changed from slate to emerald-green, and the foam resembled tumbling snow. But the men were unaware of the beauty around them, their minds consumed with thoughts of survival.

"All round them lay a thick-strewn wreckage of splintered branches and broken twigs.  Relief at being alive and exasperation at his captive plight brought a strange medley of pious thank-offerings and sharp curses to Ulrich's lips. Georg, who was early blinded with the blood which trickled across his eyes, stopped his struggling for a moment to listen, and then gave a short, snarling laugh.  ""So you're not killed, as you ought to be, but you're caught, anyway,"" he cried; ""caught fast. Ho, what a jest, Ulrich von Gradwitz snared in his stolen forest. There's real justice for you!""

The forest was shrouded in darkness, the only light coming from the faint glow of the moon filtering through the thick canopy above. The air was thick with the smell of damp earth and decaying leaves, and the ground was littered with the remnants of the fierce storm that had just passed through. The sound of branches snapping and twigs crunching underfoot echoed through the stillness, as two figures struggled against each other in the shadows. The tension between them was palpable, as they exchanged sharp words and curses, each knowing that their fate hung in the balance.

NARRATOR: 
Both men spoke with the bitterness of possible defeat before them, for each knew that it might be long before his men would seek him out or find him; it was a bare matter of chance which party would arrive first on the scene. The forest was their battleground, and their rivalry ran deep. But as they waited for their fate to be decided, a strange feeling of unease settled over them. The darkness seemed to hold secrets, and the moonlight cast eerie shadows through the trees. The forest was alive with the sound of rustling leaves and creaking branches, and the two men couldn't help but feel a sense of foreboding. They were not alone in the forest, and their fate was in the hands of fate itself.

"From the lamppost something was hanging. A shapeless dark bundle, swinging a little with the wind. Like a dummy of some sort. Loyce rolled down his window and peered out. What the hell was it? A display of some kind? Sometimes the Chamber of Commerce put up displays in the square.  Again he made a U-turn and brought his car around. He passed the park and concentrated on the dark bundle. It wasn't a dummy. And if it was a display it was a strange kind. The hackles on his neck rose and he swallowed uneasily. Sweat slid out on his face and hands.  It was a body. A human body.  ""Look at it!"" Loyce snapped. ""Come on out here!""  Don Fergusson came slowly out of the store, buttoning his pin-stripe coat with dignity. ""This is a big deal, Ed. I can't just leave the guy standing there.""  ""See it?"" Ed pointed into the gathering gloom. The lamppost jutted up against the skyâ€”the post and the bundle swinging from it. ""There it is. How the hell long has it been there?"" His voice rose excitedly. ""What's wrong with everybody? They just walk on past!""  Don Fergusson lit a cigarette slowly. ""Take it easy, old man. There must be a good reason, or it wouldn't be there.""  ""A reason! What kind of a reason?""  Fergusson shrugged. ""Like the time the Traffic Safety Council put that wrecked Buick there. Some sort of civic thing. How would I know?""  Jack Potter from the shoe shop joined them. ""What's up, boys?""  ""There's a body hanging from the lamppost,"" Loyce said. ""I'm going to call the cops.""  ""They must know about it,"" Potter said. ""Or otherwise it wouldn't be there.""  ""I got to get back in."" Fergusson headed back into the store. ""Business before pleasure.""  Loyce began to get hysterical. ""You see it? You see it hanging there? A man's body! A dead man!"" ""Sure, Ed. I saw it this afternoon when I went out for coffee.""  ""You mean it's been there all afternoon?""  ""Sure. What's the matter?"" Potter glanced at his watch. ""Have to run. See you later, Ed.""  Potter hurried off, joining the flow of people moving along the sidewalk. Men and women, passing by the park. A few glanced up curiously at the dark bundleâ€”and then went on. Nobody stopped. Nobody paid any attention.  ""I'm going nuts,"" Loyce whispered. He made his way to the curb and crossed out into traffic, among the cars. Horns honked angrily at him. He gained the curb and stepped up onto the little square of green.  The man had been middle-aged. His clothing was ripped and torn, a gray suit, splashed and caked with dried mud. A stranger. Loyce had never seen him before. Not a local man.",mystery,mysterious,"Loyce, Don Fergusson, Jack Potter","NARRATOR:

"Calixta, at home, felt no uneasiness for their safety. She sat at a side window sewing furiously on a sewing machine. She was greatly occupied and did not notice the approaching storm. But she felt very warm and often stopped to mop her face on which the perspiration gathered in beads. She unfastened her white sacque at the throat. It began to grow dark, and suddenly realizing the situation she got up hurriedly and went about closing windows and doors.  Out on the small front gallery she had hung Bobint's Sunday clothes to dry and she hastened out to gather them before the rain fell. As she stepped outside, Alce Laballire rode in at the gate. She had not seen him very often since her marriage, and never alone. She stood there with Bobint's coat in her hands, and the big rain drops began to fall. Alce rode his horse under the shelter of a side projection where the chickens had huddled and there were plows and a harrow piled up in the corner.  ""May I come and wait on your gallery till the storm is over, Calixta?"" he asked.  Come 'long in, M'sieur Alce.""  His voice and her own startled her as if from a trance, and she seized Bobint's vest. Alce, mounting to the porch, grabbed the trousers and snatched Bibi's braided jacket that was about to be carried away by a sudden gust of wind. He expressed an intention to remain outside, but it was soon apparent that he might as well have been out in the open: the water beat in upon the boards in driving sheets, and he went inside, closing the door after him. It was even necessary to put something beneath the door to keep the water out.  ""My! what a rain! It's good two years sence it rain' like that,"" exclaimed Calixta as she rolled up a piece of bagging and Alce helped her to thrust it beneath the crack.  She was a little fuller of figure than five years before when she married; but she had lost nothing of her vivacity. Her blue eyes still retained their melting quality; and her yellow hair, dishevelled by the wind and rain, kinked more stubbornly than ever about her ears and temples.  The rain beat upon the low, shingled roof with a force and clatter that threatened to break an entrance and deluge them there. They were in the dining room the sitting room the general utility room. Adjoining was her bed room, with Bibi's couch along side her own. The door stood open, and the room with its white, monumental bed, its closed shutters, looked dim and mysterious.  Alce flung himself into a rocker and Calixta nervously began to gather up from the floor the lengths of a cotton sheet which she had been sewing.",romance,Romantic,"Calixta, Bobint, Alce Laballire, Bibi","NARRATOR:

I know, it's quite the storm.

As they sat in the dimly lit room, the sound of the rain and their own breathing filled the air. Calixta's blue eyes and disheveled hair only added to her beauty, and Alce couldn't help but admire her.

CALIXTA: 
(startled) 
Bobint! I didn't hear you come in.

V.O. (Calixta) Calixta's heart raced as she heard Bobint's voice. She was so lost in her work that she didn't even notice him come in. But now, with the storm approaching, she couldn't help but feel a sense of panic. And then, Alce's sudden presence only added to her already flustered state.

BOBINT:

"She did not stop to ask if it were or were not a monstrous joy that held her. A clear and exalted perception enabled her to dismiss the suggestion as trivial. She knew that she would weep again when she saw the kind, tender hands folded in death; the face that had never looked save with love upon her, fixed and gray and dead. But she saw beyond that bitter moment a long procession of years to come that would belong to her absolutely. And she opened and spread her arms out to them in welcome.  There would be no one to live for during those coming years; she would live for herself. There would be no powerful will bending hers in that blind persistence with which men and women believe they have a right to impose a private will upon a fellow-creature.

""The Yanks are repairing the railroads,"" said the man, ""and are getting ready for another advance. They have reached the Owl Creek bridge, put it in order and built a stockade on the north bank.

""Suppose a man--a civilian and student of hanging--should elude the picket post and perhaps get the better of the sentinel,"" said Farquhar, smiling, ""what could he accomplish?""  The soldier reflected. ""I was there a month ago,"" he replied. ""I observed that the flood of last winter had lodged a great quantity of driftwood against the wooden pier at this end of the bridge. It is now dry and would burn like tow.""  The lady had now brought the water, which the soldier drank. He thanked her ceremoniously, bowed to her husband and rode away.

Could I really do it? Could I take on the Union army and burn down that bridge?

NARRATOR: 
The soldier's words about the dry driftwood lodged against the wooden pier ignite a dangerous idea in Farquhar's mind.

FARQUHAR: 
(determined) 
I have to try.

NARRATOR: 
As the night deepens, Farquhar's resolve only grows stronger. He knows the risks, but the thrill of rebellion is too enticing to ignore.

"""Do you think, Colonel, that your brave Coulter would like to put one of his guns in here?"" the general asked.  He was apparently not altogether serious; it certainly did not seem a place where any artillerist, however brave, would like to put a gun. The colonel thought that possibly his division commander meant good-humoredly to intimate that in a recent conversation between them Captain Coulter's courage had been too highly extolled.  ""General,"" he replied warmly, ""Coulter would like to put a gun anywhere within reach of those people,"" with a motion of his hand in the direction of the enemy.  ""It is the only place,"" said the general. He was serious, then.  The place was a depression, a ""notch,"" in the sharp crest of a hill. It was a pass, and through it ran a turnpike, which reaching this highest point in its course by a sinuous ascent through a thin forest made a similar, though less steep, descent toward the enemy. For a mile to the left and a mile to the right, the ridge, though occupied by Federal infantry lying close behind the sharp crest and appearing as if held in place by atmospheric pressure, was inaccessible to artillery. There was no place but the bottom of the notch, and that was barely wide enough for the roadbed. From the Confederate side this point was commanded by two batteries posted on a slightly lower elevation beyond a creek, and a half-mile away. All the guns but one were masked by the trees of an orchard; that one--it seemed a bit of impudence--was on an open lawn directly in front of a rather grandiose building, the planter's dwelling. The gun was safe enough in its exposure--but only because the Federal infantry had been forbidden to fire. Coulter's Notch--it came to be called so--was not, that pleasant summer afternoon, a place where one would ""like to put a gun.""  Three or four dead horses lay there sprawling in the road, three or four dead men in a trim row at one side of it, and a little back, down the hill.

There the warden handed Jimmy his pardon, which had been signed that morning by the governor. Jimmy took it in a tired kind of way. He had served nearly ten months of a four year sentence. He had expected to stay only about three months, at the longest. When a man with as many friends on the outside as Jimmy Valentine had is received in the ""stir"" it is hardly worth while to cut his hair.

"Jerton had not harboured the least intention of extending his thirst for name-labels to his neighbour. After her rather remarkable announcement, however, he was obliged to say something in the way of polite inquiry.  ""Yes,"" answered the lady, ""I suppose it is a case of partial loss of memory. I was in the train coming down here; my ticket told me that I had come from Victoria and was bound for this place. I had a couple of five-pound notes and a sovereign on me, no visiting cards or any other means of identification, and no idea as to who I am. I can only hazily recollect that I have a title; I am Lady Somebody - beyond that my mind is a blank.""  ""Hadn't you any luggage with you?"" asked Jerton.  ""That is what I didn't know. I knew the name of this hotel and made up my mind to come here, and when the hotel porter who meets the trains asked if I had any luggage I had to invent a dressing-bag and dress-basket; I could always pretend that they had gone astray. I gave him the name of Smith, and presently he emerged from a confused pile of luggage and passengers with a dressing- bag and dress-basket labelled Kestrel-Smith. I had to take them; I don't see what else I could have done.""  Jerton said nothing, but he rather wondered what the lawful owner of the baggage would do.  ""Of course it was dreadful arriving at a strange hotel with the name of Kestrel-Smith, but it would have been worse to have arrived without luggage. Anyhow, I hate causing trouble.""  Jerton had visions of harassed railway officials and distraught Kestrel-Smiths, but he made no attempt to clothe his mental picture in words. The lady continued her story.  ""Naturally, none of my keys would fit the things, but I told an intelligent page boy that I had lost my key-ring, and he had the locks forced in a twinkling. Rather too intelligent, that boy; he will probably end in Dartmoor. The Kestrel-Smith toilet tools aren't up to much, but they are better than nothing.""  ""If you feel sure that you have a title,"" said Jerton, "" why not get hold of a peerage and go right through it?""  ""I tried that.

"""There is a wild beast in your woods,"" said the artist Cunningham, as he was being driven to the station. It was the only remark he had made during the drive, but as Van Cheele had talked incessantly his companion's silence had not been noticeable.  ""A stray fox or two and some resident weasels. Nothing more formidable,"" said Van Cheele. The artist said nothing.  ""What did you mean about a wild beast?"" said Van Cheele later, when they were on the platform.  ""Nothing. My imagination. Here is the train,"" said Cunningham.  That afternoon Van Cheele went for one of his frequent rambles through his woodland property. He had a stuffed bittern in his study, and knew the names of quite a number of wild flowers, so his aunt had possibly some justification in describing him as a great naturalist. At any rate, he was a great walker. It was his custom to take mental notes of everything he saw during his walks, not so much for the purpose of assisting contemporary science as to provide topics for conversation afterwards. When the bluebells began to show themselves in flower he made a point of informing every one of the fact; the season of the year might have warned his hearers of the likelihood of such an occurrence, but at least they felt that he was being absolutely frank with them.  What Van Cheele saw on this particular afternoon was, however, something far removed from his ordinary range of experience. On a shelf of smooth stone overhanging a deep pool in the hollow of an oak coppice a boy of about sixteen lay asprawl, drying his wet brown limbs luxuriously in the sun. His wet hair, parted by a recent dive, lay close to his head, and his light-brown eyes, so light that there was an almost tigerish gleam in them, were turned towards Van Cheele with a certain lazy watchfulness. It was an unexpected apparition, and Van Cheele found himself engaged in the novel process of thinking before he spoke. Where on earth could this wild-looking boy hail from? The miller's wife had lost a child some two months ago, supposed to have been swept away by the mill-race, but that had been a mere baby, not a half-grown lad.  ""What are you doing there?"" he demanded.  ",mystery,suspenseful,"Van Cheele, Artist Cunningham, Wild boy","NARRATOR:

Vittoria’s legs drove in fluid efficiency—like an Olympic diver—a potency, Langdon figured, no doubt born from the flexibility and control of yoga. He could hear her breathing slowly and deliberately, as if somehow trying to filter her grief. Langdon wanted to say something to her, offer his sympathy. He too had once felt the abrupt hollowness of unexpectedly losing a parent. He remembered the funeral mostly, rainy and gray. Two days after his twelfth birthday. The house was filled with gray-suited men from the office, men who squeezed his hand too hard when they shook it. They were all mumbling words like cardiac and stress. His mother joked through teary eyes that she’d always been able to follow the stock market simply by holding her husband’s hand . . . his pulse her own private ticker tape. Once, when his father was alive, Langdon had heard his mom begging his father to “stop and smell the roses.” That year, Langdon bought his father a tiny blown glass rose for Christmas. It was the most beautiful thing Langdon had ever seen . . . the way the sun caught it, throwing a rainbow of colors on the wall. “It’s lovely,” his father had said when he opened it, kissing Robert on the forehead. “Let’s find a safe spot for it.” Then his father had carefully placed the rose on a high dusty shelf in the darkest corner of the living room. A few days later, Langdon got a stool, retrieved the rose, and took it back to the store. His father never noticed it was gone. The ping of an elevator pulled Langdon back to the present. Vittoria and Kohler were in front of him, boarding the lift. Langdon hesitated outside the open doors. “Is something wrong?” Kohler asked, sounding more impatient than concerned. “Not at all,” Langdon said, forcing himself toward the cramped carriage. He only used elevators when absolutely necessary. He preferred the more open spaces of stairwells. “Dr. Vetra’s lab is subterranean,” Kohler said. Wonderful, Langdon thought as he stepped across the cleft, feeling an icy wind churn up from the depths of the shaft. The doors closed, and the car began to descend. “Six stories,” Kohler said blankly, like an analytical engine. Langdon pictured the darkness of the empty shaft below them.

(Nodding) 
Yes, it's true. Kirrin Island has been in our family for centuries.

JULIAN: 
(Respectfully) 
That's incredible.

GEORGE: 
(Proudly) 
And now it belongs to me. My mother and I inherited it from my great-grandmother.

DICK: 
(Excitedly) 
Can we explore the island with you?

V.O. (Dick) Oh my goodness, I can't believe it! George wants us to explore Kirrin Island with her! This is going to be amazing! I've always wanted to go on an adventure and now we have a new friend to show us the way. I can't wait to see what secrets this island holds.

GEORGE: 
(Smiling) 
Of course! I'd love to show you around.

JULIAN: 
(Gratefully) 
Thank you, George. We're lucky to have a friend like you.

V.O. (Julian) Julian's mind raced as he watched George confidently claim ownership of Kirrin Island. He couldn't believe it, but he knew George wouldn't lie. As she described the island with such passion, he couldn't help but feel grateful for her friendship. This was going to be an adventure they would never forget.

GEORGE: 
(Softening) 
And I'm lucky to have friends like you. Let's go make some new memories on Kirrin Island.
