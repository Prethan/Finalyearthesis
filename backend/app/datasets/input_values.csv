"Outside the wall, at the part of the grounds farthest from the public road, were a horse and a light wagon, waiting.  The work of excavation was not difficult: the earth with which the grave had been loosely filled a few hours before offered little resistance and was soon thrown out. Removal of the casket from its box was less easy, but it was taken out, for it was a perquisite of Jess, who carefully unscrewed the cover and laid it aside, exposing the body in black trousers and white shirt. At that instant the air sprang to flame, a cracking shock of thunder shook the stunned world and Henry Armstrong tranquilly sat up. With inarticulate cries the men fled in terror, each in a different direction. For nothing on earth could two of them have been persuaded to return. But Jess was of another breed.  In the grey of the morning the two students, pallid and haggard from anxiety and with the terror of their adventure still beating tumultuously in their blood, met at the medical college.  'You saw it?' cried one.  'God! yes -- what are we to do?'  They went around to the rear of the building, where they saw a horse, attached to a light wagon, hitched to a gatepost near the door of the dissecting-room. Mechanically they entered the room. On a bench in the obscurity sat the negro Jess. He rose, grinning, all eyes and teeth.  'I'm waiting for my pay,' he said.  Stretched naked on a long table lay the body of Henry Armstrong, the head defiled with blood and clay from a blow with a spade.","Jess, Henry Armstrong, Student 1, Student 2",horror,suspenseful
"The young woman's glance fell upon them with a distant, swift disinterest; then with a lovely smile brightening her countenance and a tender pink tingeing her rounded cheeks, she held out a little gray-gloved hand. When she spoke her voice, full, sweet, and deliberate, proclaimed that its owner was accustomed to speak and be heard.  ""Well, Mr. Easton, if you will make me speak first, I suppose I must. Don't you ever recognize old friends when you meet them in the West?""  The younger man roused himself sharply at the sound of her voice, seemed to struggle with a slight embarrassment which he threw off instantly, and then clasped her fingers with his left hand.  ""It's Miss Fairchild,"" he said, with a smile. ""I'll ask you to excuse the other hand; ""it's otherwise engaged just at present.""  He slightly raised his right hand, bound at the wrist by the shining ""bracelet"" to the left one of his companion. The glad look in the girl's eyes slowly changed to a bewildered horror. The glow faded from her cheeks. Her lips parted in a vague, relaxing distress. Easton, with a little laugh, as if amused, was about to speak again when the other forestalled him. The glum-faced man had been watching the girl's countenance with veiled glances from his keen, shrewd eyes.  ""You'll excuse me for speaking, miss, but, I see you're acquainted with the marshal here. If you'll ask him to speak a word for me when we get to the pen he'll do it, and it'll make things easier for me there. He's taking me to Leavenworth prison. It's seven years for counterfeiting.""  ""Oh!"" said the girl, with a deep breath and returning color. ""So that is what you are doing out here? A marshal!""","Miss Fairchild, Mr. Easton, Glum-faced man",romance,romantic
"The children were at play in their play-ground one day, when a herald rode through the town, blowing a trumpet, and crying aloud, ""The King! the King passes by this road to-day. Make ready for the King!"" The children stopped their play, and looked at one another.  ""Did you hear that?"" they said. ""The King is coming. He may look over the wall and see our playground; who knows? We must put it in order.""  The playground was sadly dirty, and in the corners were scraps of paper and broken toys, for these were careless children. But now, one brought a hoe, and another a rake, and a third ran to fetch the wheelbarrow from behind the garden gate. They labored hard, till at length all was clean and tidy.  ""Now it is clean!"" they said; ""but we must make it pretty, too, for kings are used to fine things; maybe he would not notice mere cleanness, for he may have it all the time.""  Then one brought sweet rushes and strewed them on the ground; and others made garlands of oak leaves and pine tassels and hung them on the walls; and the littlest one pulled marigold buds and threw them all about the playground, ""to look like gold,"" he said.  When all was done the playground was so beautiful that the children stood and looked at it, and clapped their hands with pleasure.  ""Let us keep it always like this!"" said the littlest one; and the others cried, ""Yes! yes! that is what we will do.""  They waited all day for the coming of the King, but he never came; only, towards sunset, a man with travel-worn clothes, and a kind, tired face passed along the road, and stopped to look over the wall.","Herald, Children, Man with travel-worn clothes",drama,optimistic
"Out of the drawer they took about ten little packages of yellow paper, tied with care and arranged one beside the other. They threw these relics on the bed and chose one of them on which the word ""Father"" was written. They opened and read it.  It was one of those old-fashioned letters which one finds in old family desk drawers, those epistles which smell of another century. The first one started: ""My dear,"" another one: ""My beautiful little girl,"" others: ""My dear child,"" or: ""My dear daughter."" And suddenly the nun began to read aloud, to read over to the dead woman her whole history, all her tender memories. The judge, resting his elbow on the bed, was listening with his eyes fastened on his mother. The motionless body seemed happy.  Sister Eulalie, interrupting herself, said suddenly:  ""These ought to be put in the grave with her; they ought to be used as a shroud and she ought to be buried in it."" She took another package, on which no name was written. She began to read in a firm voice: ""My adored one, I love you wildly. Since yesterday I have been suffering the tortures of the damned, haunted by our memory. I feel your lips against mine, your eyes in mine, your breast against mine. I love you, I love you! You have driven me mad. My arms open, I gasp, moved by a wild desire to hold you again. My whole soul and body cries out for you, wants you. I have kept in my mouth the taste of your kisses--""  The judge had straightened himself up. The nun stopped reading. He snatched the letter from her and looked for the signature. There was none, but only under the words, ""The man who adores you,"" the name ""Henry."" Their father's name was Rene. Therefore this was not from him. The son then quickly rummaged through the package of letters, took one out and read: ""I can no longer live without your caresses."" Standing erect, severe as when sitting on the bench, he looked unmoved at the dead woman. The nun, straight as a statue, tears trembling in the corners of her eyes, was watching her brother, waiting. Then he crossed the room slowly, went to the window and stood there, gazing out into the dark night.  When he turned around again Sister Eulalie, her eyes dry now, was still standing near the bed, her head bent down.","Sister Eulalie,  Judge, Dead woman, Henry",drama,serious
"Eleven o'clock had struck some half-hour ago, and the elder Steffinks began to throw out suggestions leading up to that process which they called retiring for the night.  ""Come, Teddie, it's time you were in your little bed, you know,"" said Luke Steffink to his thirteen-year-old son.  ""That's where we all ought to be,"" said Mrs. Steffink.  ""There wouldn't be room,"" said Bertie.  The remark was considered to border on the scandalous; everybody ate raisins and almonds with the nervous industry of sheep feeding during threatening weather.  ""In Russia,"" said Horace Bordenby, who was staying in the house as a Christmas guest, ""I've read that the peasants believe that if you go into a cow-house or stable at midnight on Christmas Eve you will hear the animals talk. They're supposed to have the gift of speech at that one moment of the year.""  ""Oh, do let's  all go down to the cow-house and listen to what they've got to say!"" exclaimed Beryl, to whom anything was thrilling and amusing if you did it in a troop.  Mrs. Steffink made a laughing protest, but gave a virtual consent by saying, ""We must all wrap up well, then."" The idea seemed a scatterbrained one to her, and almost heathenish, but if afforded an opportunity for ""throwing the young people together,"" and as such she welcomed it. Mr. Horace Bordenby was a young man with quite substantial prospects, and he had danced with Beryl at a local subscription ball a sufficient number of times to warrant the authorised inquiry on the part of the neighbours whether ""there was anything in it."" Though Mrs. Steffink would not have put it in so many words, she shared the idea of the Russian peasantry that on this night the beast might speak.","Luke Steffink, Mrs. Steffink, Bertie Steffink, Horace Bordenby, Beryl",fiction,humorous 
"The evening was at the period when reserve is thawed. One of us mentioned three Wurzburgers to the waiter; the dark-haired young man acknowledged his inclusion in the order by a smile and a nod. I hastened to ask him a question because I wanted to try out a theory I had.  ""Would you mind telling me,"" I began, ""whether you are from--""  The fist of E. Rushmore Coglan banged the table and I was jarred into silence.  ""Excuse me,"" said he, ""but that's a question I never like to hear asked. What does it matter where a man is from? Is it fair to judge a man by his post-office address? Why, I've seen Kentuckians who hated whiskey, Virginians who weren't descended from Pocahontas, Indianians who hadn't written a novel, Mexicans who didn't wear velvet trousers with silver dollars sewed along the seams, funny Englishmen, spendthrift Yankees, cold-blooded Southerners, narrow- minded Westerners, and New Yorkers who were too busy to stop for an hour on the street to watch a one-armed grocer's clerk do up cranberries in paper bags. Let a man be a man and don't handicap him with the label of any section.""  ""Pardon me,"" I said, ""but my curiosity was not altogether an idle one. I know the South, and when the band plays 'Dixie' I like to observe. I have formed the belief that the man who applauds that air with special violence and ostensible sectional loyalty is invariably a native of either Secaucus, N.J., or the district between Murray Hill Lyceum and the Harlem River, this city. I was about to put my opinion to the test by inquiring of this gentleman when you interrupted with your own--larger theory, I must confess.""  And now the dark-haired young man spoke to me, and it became evident that his mind also moved along its own set of grooves.  ""I should like to be a periwinkle,"" said he, mysteriously, ""on the top of a valley, and sing tooralloo-ralloo.""  This was clearly too obscure, so I turned again to Coglan.","Narrator, E.

"Josefa was standing in her tracks, quietly reloading her silver- mounted .38. It had not been a difficult shot. The lion's head made an easier mark than a tomato-can swinging at the end of a string. There was a provoking, teasing, maddening smile upon her mouth and in her dark eyes. The would-be-rescuing knight felt the fire of his fiasco burn down to his soul. Here had been his chance, the chance that he had dreamed of; and Momus, and not Cupid, had presided over it. The satyrs in the wood were, no doubt, holding their sides in hilarious, silent laughter. There had been something like vaudeville--say Signor Givens and his funny knockabout act with the stuffed lion.  ""Is that you, Mr. Givens?"" said Josefa, in her deliberate, saccharine contralto. ""You nearly spoilt my shot when you yelled. Did you hurt your head when you fell?""  ""Oh, no,"" said Givens, quietly; ""that didn't hurt."" He stooped ignominiously and dragged his best Stetson hat from under the beast. It was crushed and wrinkled to a fine comedy effect. Then he knelt down and softly stroked the fierce, open-jawed head of the dead lion.  ""Poor old Bill!"" he exclaimed mournfully.  ""What's that?"" asked Josefa, sharply.  ""Of course you didn't know, Miss Josefa,"" said Givens, with an air of one allowing magnanimity to triumph over grief. ""Nobody can blame you. I tried to save him, but I couldn't let you know in time.""  ""Save who?""  ""Why, Bill. I've been looking for him all day. You see, he's been our camp pet for two years. Poor old fellow, he wouldn't have hurt a cottontail rabbit. It'll break the boys all up when they hear about it. But you couldn't tell, of course, that Bill was just trying to play with you.""  Josefa's black eyes burned steadily upon him. Ripley Givens met the test successfully. He stood rumpling the yellow-brown curls on his head pensively. In his eye was regret, not unmingled with a gentle reproach. His smooth features were set to a pattern of indisputable sorrow. Josefa wavered.  ""What was your pet doing here?"" she asked, making a last stand. ""There's no camp near the White Horse Crossing.""  ""The old rascal ran away from camp yesterday,"" answered Givens readily.

"When Hughie came in he found Trevor putting the finishing touches to a wonderful life-size picture of a beggar-man. The beggar himself was standing on a raised platform in a corner of the studio. He was a wizened old man, with a face like wrinkled parchment, and a most piteous expression. Over his shoulders was flung a coarse brown cloak, all tears and tatters; his thick boots were patched and cobbled, and with one hand he leant on a rough stick, while with the other he held out his battered hat for alms.  'What an amazing model!' whispered Hughie, as he shook hands with his friend.  'An amazing model?' shouted Trevor at the top of his voice; 'I should think so! Such beggars as he are not to be met with every day. A trouvaille, mort cher; a living Velasquez! My stars! what an etching Rembrandt would have made of him!'  'Poor old chap! said Hughie, 'how miserable he looks! But I suppose, to you painters, his face is his fortune?'  'Certainly,' replied Trevor, 'you don't want a beggar to look happy, do you?'  'How much does a model get for sitting?' asked Hughie, as he found himself a comfortable seat on a divan.  'A shilling an hour.'  'And how much do you get for your picture, Alan?'  'Oh, for this I get two thousand!'  'Pounds?'  'Guineas. Painters, poets, and physicians always get guineas.'  'Well, I think the model should have a percentage,' cried Hughie, laughing; 'they work quite as hard as you do.'  'Nonsense, nonsense! Why, look at the trouble of laying on the paint alone, and standing all day long at one's easel! It's all very well, Hughie, for you to talk, but I assure you that there are moments when Art almost attains to the dignity of manual labour. But you mustn't chatter; I'm very busy. Smoke a cigarette, and keep quiet.'  After some time the servant came in, and told Trevor that the frame-maker wanted to speak to him.","Hughie, Trevor, Beggar-man, Servant, Frame-maker",comedy,humorous 
"He seemed unwilling to leave anything to the imagination of a casual observer, and his talk grew presently personal and introspective.  ""I don't know how it is,"" he told his friend, ""I'm not much over forty, but I seem to have settled down into a deep groove of elderly middle-age. My sister shows the same tendency. We like everything to be exactly in its accustomed place; we like things to happen exactly at their appointed times; we like everything to be usual, orderly, punctual, methodical, to a hair's breadth, to a minute. It distresses and upsets us if it is not so. For instance, to take a very trifling matter, a thrush has built its nest year after year in the catkin- tree on the lawn; this year, for no obvious reason, it is building in the ivy on the garden wall. We have said very little about it, but I think we both feel that the change is unnecessary, and just a little irritating.""  ""Perhaps,"" said the friend, ""it is a different thrush.""  ""We have suspected that,"" said J. P. Huddle, ""and I think it gives us even more cause for annoyance. We don't feel that we want a change of thrush at our time of life; and yet, as I have said, we have scarcely reached an age when these things should make themselves seriously felt.""  ""What you want,"" said the friend, ""is an Unrest-cure.""  ""An Unrest-cure? I've never heard of such a thing.""  ""You've heard of Rest-cures for people who've broken down under stress of too much worry and strenuous living; well, you're suffering from overmuch repose and placidity, and you need the opposite kind of treatment.""  ""But where would one go for such a thing?""  ""Well, you might stand as an Orange candidate for Kilkenny, or do a course of district visiting in one of the Apache quarters of Paris, or give lectures in Berlin to prove that most of Wagner's music was written by Gambetta; and there's always the interior of Morocco to travel in. But, to be really effective, the Unrest-cure ought to be tried in the home. How you would do it I haven't the faintest idea.""","J. P. Huddle, Friend",comedy,humorous 
"Filled with amazement and terror by this apparition of a horseman in the sky--half believing himself the chosen scribe of some new Apocalypse, the officer was overcome by the intensity of his emotions; his legs failed him and he fell. Almost at the same instant he heard a crashing sound in the trees--a sound that died without an echo--and all was still.  The officer rose to his feet, trembling. The familiar sensation of an abraded shin recalled his dazed faculties. Pulling himself together he ran rapidly obliquely away from the cliff to a point distant from its foot; thereabout he expected to find his man; and thereabout he naturally failed. In the fleeting instant of his vision his imagination had been so wrought upon by the apparent grace and ease and intention of the marvelous performance that it did not occur to him that the line of march of arial cavalry is directly downward, and that he could find the objects of his search at the very foot of the cliff. A half-hour later he returned to camp.  This officer was a wise man; he knew better than to tell an incredible truth. He said nothing of what he had seen. But when the commander asked him if in his scout he had learned anything of advantage to the expedition he answered:  ""Yes, sir; there is no road leading down into this valley from the southward.""  The commander, knowing better, smiled.  After firing his shot, Private Carter Druse reloaded his rifle and resumed his watch. Ten minutes had hardly passed when a Federal sergeant crept cautiously to him on hands and knees. Druse neither turned his head nor looked at him, but lay without motion or sign of recognition.  ""Did you fire?"" the sergeant whispered.  ""Yes.""  ""At what?""  ""A horse. It was standing on yonder rock--pretty far out. You see it is no longer there. It went over the cliff.""  The man's face was white, but he showed no other sign of emotion. Having answered, he turned away his eyes and said no more. The sergeant did not understand.  ""See here, Druse,"" he said, after a moment's silence, ""it's no use making a mystery. I order you to report. Was there anybody on the horse?""  ""Yes.""  ""Well?""  ""My father.""  The sergeant rose to his feet and walked away. ""Good God!"" he said.","Officer, commander, Private Carter Druse, Federal sergeant",drama,suspenseful
"That night the city wore the mask of a capital. The five young men strolled along Stephen's Green in a faint cloud of aromatic smoke. They talked loudly and gaily and their cloaks dangled from their shoulders. The people made way for them. At the corner of Grafton Street a short fat man was putting two handsome ladies on a car in charge of another fat man. The car drove off and the short fat man caught sight of the party.  ""Andre.""  ""It's Farley!""  A torrent of talk followed. Farley was an American. No one knew very well what the talk was about. Villona and Riviere were the noisiest, but all the men were excited. They got up on a car, squeezing themselves together amid much laughter. They drove by the crowd, blended now into soft colours, to a music of merry bells. They took the train at Westland Row and in a few seconds, as it seemed to Jimmy, they were walking out of Kingstown Station. The ticket-collector saluted Jimmy; he was an old man:  ""Fine night, sir!""  It was a serene summer night; the harbour lay like a darkened mirror at their feet. They proceeded towards it with linked arms, singing Cadet Roussel in chorus, stamping their feet at every:  ""Ho! Ho! Hohe, vraiment!""  They got into a rowboat at the slip and made out for the American's yacht. There was to be supper, music, cards. Villona said with conviction:  ""It is delightful!""  There was a yacht piano in the cabin. Villona played a waltz for Farley and Riviere, Farley acting as cavalier and Riviere as lady. Then an impromptu square dance, the men devising original figures. What merriment! Jimmy took his part with a will; this was seeing life, at least. Then Farley got out of breath and cried ""Stop!"" A man brought in a light supper, and the young men sat down to it for form's sake. They drank, however: it was Bohemian. They drank Ireland, England, France, Hungary, the United States of America. Jimmy made a speech, a long speech, Villona saying: ""Hear! hear!"" whenever there was a pause. There was a great clapping of hands when he sat down. It must have been a good speech. Farley clapped him on the back and laughed loudly. What jovial fellows! What good company they were!","Five young men, Farley, Villona, Riviere, Jimmy",fiction,optimistic
"Picture followed picture against the grey background. Now Nellie saw herself one winter night knocking at the door of Stepan Lukitch, the district doctor. The old dog hoarsely and lazily barked behind the gate. The doctor's windows were in darkness. All was silence.  ""For God's sake, for God's sake!"" whispered Nellie.  But at last the garden gate creaked and Nellie saw the doctor's cook.  ""Is the doctor at home?""  ""His honour's asleep,"" whispered the cook into her sleeve, as though afraid of waking her master.  ""He's only just got home from his fever patients, and gave orders he was not to be waked.""  But Nellie scarcely heard the cook. Thrusting her aside, she rushed headlong into the doctor's house. Running through some dark and stuffy rooms, upsetting two or three chairs, she at last reached the doctor's bedroom. Stepan Lukitch was lying on his bed, dressed, but without his coat, and with pouting lips was breathing into his open hand. A little night-light glimmered faintly beside him. Without uttering a word Nellie sat down and began to cry. She wept bitterly, shaking all over.  ""My husband is ill!"" she sobbed out. Stepan Lukitch was silent. He slowly sat up, propped his head on his hand, and looked at his visitor with fixed, sleepy eyes. ""My husband is ill!"" Nellie continued, restraining her sobs. ""For mercy's sake come quickly. Make haste. . . . Make haste!""  ""Eh?"" growled the doctor, blowing into his hand.  ""Come! Come this very minute! Or . . . it's terrible to think! For mercy's sake!""  And pale, exhausted Nellie, gasping and swallowing her tears, began describing to the doctor her husband's illness, her unutterable terror.

"It was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season, that I encountered my friend. He accosted me with excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much. The man wore motley. He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him that I thought I should never have done wringing his hand.  I said to him --""My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met. How remarkably well you are looking to-day. But I have received a pipe of what passes for Amontillado, and I have my doubts.""  ""How?"" said he. ""Amontillado, A pipe? Impossible! And in the middle of the carnival!""  ""I have my doubts,"" I replied; ""and I was silly enough to pay the full Amontillado price without consulting you in the matter. You were not to be found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.""  ""Amontillado!""  ""I have my doubts.""  ""Amontillado!""  ""And I must satisfy them.""  ""Amontillado!""  ""As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchresi. If any one has a critical turn it is he. He will tell me --""  ""Luchresi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.""  ""And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your own.  ""Come, let us go.""  ""Whither?""  ""To your vaults.""  ""My friend, no; I will not impose upon your good nature. I perceive you have an engagement. Luchresi--""  ""I have no engagement; --come.""  ""My friend, no. It is not the engagement, but the severe cold with which I perceive you are afflicted. The vaults are insufferably damp. They are encrusted with nitre.""  ""Let us go, nevertheless. The cold is merely nothing. Amontillado! You have been imposed upon. And as for Luchresi, he cannot distinguish Sherry from Amontillado.""

"The Skin Horse had lived longer in the nursery than any of the others. He was so old that his brown coat was bald in patches and showed the seams underneath, and most of the hairs in his tail had been pulled out to string bead necklaces. He was wise, for he had seen a long succession of mechanical toys arrive to boast and swagger, and by-and-by break their mainsprings and pass away, and he knew that they were only toys, and would never turn into anything else. For nursery magic is very strange and wonderful, and only those playthings that are old and wise and experienced like the Skin Horse understand all about it.  ""What is REAL?"" asked the Rabbit one day, when they were lying side by side near the nursery fender, before Nana came to tidy the room. ""Does it mean having things that buzz inside you and a stick-out handle?""  ""Real isn't how you are made,"" said the Skin Horse. ""It's a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real.""  ""Does it hurt?"" asked the Rabbit.  ""Sometimes,"" said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful. ""When you are Real you don't mind being hurt.""  ""Does it happen all at once, like being wound up,"" he asked, ""or bit by bit?""  ""It doesn't happen all at once,"" said the Skin Horse. ""You become. It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand.""  ""I suppose you are Real?"" said the Rabbit. And then he wished he had not said it, for he thought the Skin Horse might be sensitive. But the Skin Horse only smiled.","Skin Horse, Rabbit, Nana",fiction,optimistic
"I walked and walked along the cold wet sand, making my chattering teeth warble in honour of cold and hunger, when suddenly, as I was carefully searching for something to eat behind one of the empty crates, I perceived behind it, crouching on the ground, a figure in woman's clothes dank with the rain and clinging fast to her stooping shoulders. Standing over her, I watched to see what she was doing. It appeared that she was digging a trench in the sand with her hands--digging away under one of the crates.  ""Why are you doing that?"" I asked, crouching down on my heels quite close to her.  She gave a little scream and was quickly on her legs again. Now that she stood there staring at me, with her wide-open grey eyes full of terror, I perceived that it was a girl of my own age, with a very pleasant face embellished unfortunately by three large blue marks. This spoilt her, although these blue marks had been distributed with a remarkable sense of proportion, one at a time, and all were of equal size--two under the eyes, and one a little bigger on the forehead just over the bridge of the nose. This symmetry was evidently the work of an artist well inured to the business of spoiling the human physiognomy.  The girl looked at me, and the terror in her eyes gradually died out... She shook the sand from her hands, adjusted her cotton head-gear, cowered down, and said:  ""I suppose you too want something to eat? Dig away then! My hands are tired. Over there""--she nodded her head in the direction of a booth--""there is bread for certain ... and sausages too... That booth is still carrying on business.""  I began to dig. She, after waiting a little and looking at me, sat down beside me and began to help me.  We worked in silence. I cannot say now whether I thought at that moment of the criminal code, of morality, of proprietorship, and all the other things about which, in the opinion of many experienced persons, one ought to think every moment of one's life. Wishing to keep as close to the truth as possible, I must confess that apparently I was so deeply engaged in digging under the crate that I completely forgot about everything else except this one thing: What could be inside that crate?

"Olenka, the daughter of the retired collegiate assessor, Plemyanniakov, was sitting in her back porch, lost in thought. It was hot, the flies were persistent and teasing, and it was pleasant to reflect that it would soon be evening. Dark rainclouds were gathering from the east, and bringing from time to time a breath of moisture in the air.  Kukin, who was the manager of an open-air theatre called the Tivoli, and who lived in the lodge, was standing in the middle of the garden looking at the sky.  ""Again!"" he observed despairingly. ""It's going to rain again! Rain every day, as though to spite me. I might as well hang myself! It's ruin! Fearful losses every day.""  He flung up his hands, and went on, addressing Olenka:  ""There! that's the life we lead, Olga Semyonovna. It's enough to make one cry. One works and does one's utmost, one wears oneself out, getting no sleep at night, and racks one's brain what to do for the best. And then what happens? To begin with, one's public is ignorant, boorish. I give them the very best operetta, a dainty masque, first rate music-hall artists. But do you suppose that's what they want! They don't understand anything of that sort. They want a clown; what they ask for is vulgarity. And then look at the weather! Almost every evening it rains. It started on the tenth of May, and it's kept it up all May and June. It's simply awful! The public doesn't come, but I've to pay the rent just the same, and pay the artists.""  The next evening the clouds would gather again, and Kukin would say with an hysterical laugh:  ""Well, rain away, then! Flood the garden, drown me! Damn my luck in this world and the next! Let the artists have me up! Send me to prison! -- to Siberia! -- the scaffold! Ha, ha, ha!""  And next day the same thing.  Olenka listened to Kukin with silent gravity, and sometimes tears came into her eyes. In the end his misfortunes touched her; she grew to love him. He was a small thin man, with a yellow face, and curls combed forward on his forehead. He spoke in a thin tenor; as he talked his mouth worked on one side, and there was always an expression of despair on his face; yet he aroused a deep and genuine affection in her.

He was mentally adrift upon the Hints and Helps to Young Men in Business and Social Relations, which had suggested to him his present enterprise, when the appearance of a second youth, taller and broader than himself, with a shock of light curling hair and a crop of freckles that advertised a rich soil threw him a lifeline. He put his thumbs to his lips and whistled in a peculiarly ear-splitting way. The two boys had sat on the same bench at Sunday-school not three hours before; yet what a change had come over the world for one of them since then!  ""Hello! Where you goin', Ab?"" asked the newcomer, gruffly.  ""Callin',"" replied the boy in the collar, laconically, but with carefully averted gaze.  ""On the girls?"" inquired the other, awestruck. In Mount Pisgah you saw the girls home from night church, socials, or parties; you could hang over the gate; and you might walk with a girl in the cemetery of a Sunday afternoon; but to ring a front-door bell and ask for Miss Heart's Desire one must have been in long trousers at least three years”and the two boys confronted in the dusty road had worn these dignifying garments barely six months.  ""Girls,"" said Abner, loftily; ""I don't know about girls”I'm just going to call on one girl”Champe Claiborne."" He marched on as though the conversation was at an end; but Ross hung upon his flank. Ross and Champe were neighbors, comrades in all sorts of mischief; he was in doubt whether to halt Abner and pummel him, or propose to enlist under his banner.  ""Do you reckon you could?"" he debated, trotting along by the irresponsive Jilton boy.  ""Run home to your mother,"" growled the originator of the plan, savagely. ""You ain't old enough to call on girls; anybody can see that; but I am, and I'm going to call on Champe Claiborne.""  Again the name acted as a spur on Ross. ""With your collar and boots all dirty?"" he jeered. ""They won't know you're callin'.""  The boy in the road stopped short in his dusty tracks. He was an intense creature, and he whitened at the tragic insinuation, longing for the wholesome stay and companionship of freckle-faced Ross. ""I put the dirt on o' purpose so's to look kind of careless,"" he half whispered, in an agony of doubt.

"Mr. Pneumonia was not what you would call a chivalric old gentleman. A mite of a little woman with blood thinned by California zephyrs was hardly fair game for the red-fisted, short-breathed old duffer. But Johnsy he smote; and she lay, scarcely moving, on her painted iron bedstead, looking through the small Dutch window-panes at the blank side of the next brick house.  One morning the busy doctor invited Sue into the hallway with a shaggy, gray eyebrow.  ""She has one chance in - let us say, ten,"" he said, as he shook down the mercury in his clinical thermometer. "" And that chance is for her to want to live. This way people have of lining-u on the side of the undertaker makes the entire pharmacopoeia look silly. Your little lady has made up her mind that she's not going to get well. Has she anything on her mind?""  ""She - she wanted to paint the Bay of Naples some day."" said Sue.  ""Paint? - bosh! Has she anything on her mind worth thinking twice - a man for instance?""  ""A man?"" said Sue, with a jew's-harp twang in her voice. ""Is a man worth - but, no, doctor; there is nothing of the kind.""  ""Well, it is the weakness, then,"" said the doctor. ""I will do all that science, so far as it may filter through my efforts, can accomplish. But whenever my patient begins to count the carriages in her funeral procession I subtract 50 per cent from the curative power of medicines. If you will get her to ask one question about the new winter styles in cloak sleeves I will promise you a one-in-five chance for her, instead of one in ten.""  After the doctor had gone Sue went into the workroom and cried a Japanese napkin to a pulp. Then she swaggered into Johnsy's room with her drawing board, whistling ragtime.  Johnsy lay, scarcely making a ripple under the bedclothes, with her face toward the window. Sue stopped whistling, thinking she was asleep.  She arranged her board and began a pen-and-ink drawing to illustrate a magazine story. Young artists must pave their way to Art by drawing pictures for magazine stories that young authors write to pave their way to Literature.  As Sue was sketching a pair of elegant horseshow riding trousers and a monocle of the figure of the hero, an Idaho cowboy, she heard a low sound, several times repeated.","Mr. Pneumonia, Johnsy, Sue, Doctor, Behrman",drama,optimistic
"Every Sunday he met in this very spot Monsieur Sauvage, a stout, jolly, little man, a draper in the Rue Notre Dame de Lorette, and also an ardent fisherman. They often spent half the day side by side, rod in hand and feet dangling over the water, and a warm friendship had sprung up between the two.  Some days they did not speak; at other times they chatted; but they understood each other perfectly without the aid of words, having similar tastes and feelings.  In the spring, about ten o'clock in the morning, when the early sun caused a light mist to float on the water and gently warmed the backs of the two enthusiastic anglers, Morissot would occasionally remark to his neighbor:  ""My, but it's pleasant here.""  To which the other would reply:  ""I can't imagine anything better!""  And these few words sufficed to make them understand and appreciate each other.  In the autumn, toward the close of day, when the setting sun shed a blood-red glow over the western sky, and the reflection of the crimson clouds tinged the whole river with red, brought a glow to the faces of the two friends, and gilded the trees, whose leaves were already turning at the first chill touch of winter, Monsieur Sauvage would sometimes smile at Morissot, and say:  ""What a glorious spectacle!""  And Morissot would answer, without taking his eyes from his float:  ""This is much better than the boulevard, isn't it?""  As soon as they recognized each other they shook hands cordially, affected at the thought of meeting under such changed circumstances.  Monsieur Sauvage, with a sigh, murmured:  ""These are sad times!""  Morissot shook his head mournfully.  ""And such weather! This is the first fine day of the year.""  The sky was, in fact, of a bright, cloudless blue.  They walked along, side by side, reflective and sad.  ""And to think of the fishing!"" said Morissot. ""What good times we used to have!""  ""When shall we be able to fish again?"" asked Monsieur Sauvage.  They entered a small cafe and took an absinthe together, then resumed their walk along the pavement.  Morissot stopped suddenly.  ""Shall we have another absinthe?"" he said.  ""If you like,"" agreed Monsieur Sauvage.  And they entered another wine shop.  They were quite unsteady when they came out, owing to the effect of the alcohol on their empty stomachs. ","Monsieur Sauvage, Morissot, Colonel Dumoulin",drama,serious
"There is a great deal to recommend a plains journey at first. Later, there is nothing at all to recommend it. It has the same monotony as a voyage at sea, only there is less living room, and, instead of being carried, you must progress to a great extent by your own volition. Also the food is coarse, the water poor, and you cannot bathe. To a plainsman, or a man who has the instinct, these things are as nothing in comparison with the charm of the outdoor life, and the pleasing tingling of adventure. But woman is a creature wedded to comfort. She also has a strange instinctive desire to be entirely alone every once in a while, probably because her experiences, while not less numerous than man's, are mainly psychical, and she needs occasionally time to get ""thought up to date."" So Miss Caldwell began to get very impatient.  The afternoon of the sixth day Alfred, Miss Caldwell, and Allen rode along side by side. Alfred was telling a self-effacing story of adventure, and Miss Caldwell was listening carelessly because she had nothing else to do. Allen chaffed lazily when the fancy took him.  ""I happened to have a limb broken at the time,"" Alfred was observing, parenthetically, in his soft tones, ""and so----""  ""What kind of a limb?"" asked the young Easterner, with direct brutality. He glanced with a half-humourous aside at the girl, to whom the little man had been mainly addressing himself.  Alfred hesitated, blushed, lost the thread of his tale, and finally in great confusion reined back his horse by the harsh Spanish bit. He fell to the rear of the little wagon-train, where he hung his head, and went hot and cold by turns in thinking of such an indiscretion before a lady.  The young Easterner spurred up on the right of the girl's mount.  ""He's the queerest little fellow I ever saw!"" he observed, with a laugh. ""Sorry to spoil his story. Was it a good one?""  ""It might have been if you hadn't spoiled it,"" answered the girl, flicking her horse's ears mischievously. The animal danced. ""What did you do it for?""  ""Oh, just to see him squirm. He'll think about that all the rest of the afternoon, and will hardly dare look you in the face next time you meet.""  ""I know. Isn't he funny? The other morning he came around the corner of the wagon and caught me with my hair down. I wish you could have seen him!""  She laughed gayly at the memory.

"The man whose story is here to be told was the wealthiest and most influential person in his parish; his name was Thord Overaas. He appeared in the priest's study one day, tall and earnest. ""I have gotten a son,"" said he, ""and I wish to present him for baptism.""  ""What shall his name be?""  ""Finn,â€”after my father.""  ""And the sponsors?""  They were mentioned, and proved to be the best men and women of Thord's relations in the parish.  ""Is there anything else?"" inquired the priest, and looked up.  The peasant hesitated a little.  ""I should like very much to have him baptized by himself,"" said he, finally.  ""That is to say on a week-day?""  ""Next Saturday, at twelve o'clock noon.""  ""Is there anything else?"" inquired the priest.  ""There is nothing else;"" and the peasant twirled his cap, as though he were about to go.  Then the priest rose. ""There is yet this, however,"" said he, and walking toward Thord, he took him by the hand and looked gravely into his eyes: ""God grant that the child may become a blessing to you!""  One day sixteen years later, Thord stood once more in the priest's study.  ""Really, you carry your age astonishingly well, Thord,"" said the priest; for he saw no change whatever in the man.  ""That is because I have no troubles,"" replied Thord.  To this the priest said nothing, but after a while he asked: ""What is your pleasure this evening?""  ""I have come this evening about that son of mine who is to be confirmed to-morrow.""  ""He is a bright boy.""  ""I did not wish to pay the priest until I heard what number the boy would have when he takes his place in church to-morrow.""  ""He will stand number one.'  ""So I have heard; and here are ten dollars for the priest.""  ""Is there anything else I can do for you?"" inquired the priest, fixing his eyes on Thord.  ""There is nothing else.""  Thord went out.  Eight years more rolled by, and then one day a noise was heard outside of the priest's study, for many men were approaching, and at their head was Thord, who entered first.  The priest looked up and recognized him.  ""You come well attended this evening, Thord,""  ""I am here to request that the banns may be published for my son; he is about to marry Karen Storliden, daughter of Gudmund, who stands here beside me.""  ""Why, that is the richest girl in the parish.""  ""So they say,"" replied the peasant, stroking back his hair with one hand.

"The train rolled on, still passing through hamlets occupied by the victorious army. German soldiers could be seen along the roads, on the edges of fields, standing in front of gates or chatting outside cafes. They covered the soil like African locusts.  The officer said, with a wave of his hand:  ""If I had been in command, I'd have taken Paris, burned everything, killed everybody. No more France!""  The Englishman, through politeness, replied simply:  ""Ah! yes.""  He went on:  ""In twenty years all Europe, all of it, will belong to us. Prussia is more than a match for all of them.""  The Englishmen, getting uneasy, no longer replied. Their faces, which had become impassive, seemed made of wax behind their long whiskers. Then the Prussian officer began to laugh. And still, lolling back, he began to sneer. He sneered at the downfall of France, insulted the prostrate enemy; he sneered at Austria, which had been recently conquered; he sneered at the valiant but fruitless defence of the departments; he sneered at the Garde Mobile and at the useless artillery. He announced that Bismarck was going to build a city of iron with the captured cannon. And suddenly he placed his boots against the thigh of M. Dubuis, who turned away his eyes, reddening to the roots of his hair.  The Englishmen seemed to have become indifferent to all that was going on, as if they were suddenly shut up in their own island, far from the din of the world.  The officer took out his pipe, and looking fixedly at the Frenchman, said:  ""You haven't any tobacco--have you?""  M. Dubuis replied:  ""No, monsieur.""  The German resumed:  ""You might go and buy some for me when the train stops.""  And he began laughing afresh as he added:  ""I'll give you the price of a drink.""  The train whistled, and slackened its pace. They passed a station that had been burned down; and then they stopped altogether.  The German opened the carriage door, and, catching M. Dubuis by the arm, said:  ""Go and do what I told you--quick, quick!""  A Prussian detachment occupied the station. Other soldiers were standing behind wooden gratings, looking on. The engine was getting up steam before starting off again. Then M. Dubuis hurriedly jumped on the platform, and, in spite of the warnings of the station master, dashed into the adjoining compartment.

"One glance over the crumbling wall at the edge was generally sufficient for a visitor of even the strongest nerves. There was a sheer drop of more than a mile straight down, and at the distant bottom were jagged rocks and stunted trees that looked, in the blue haze, like shrubbery.  ""This is the spot,"" said the man to himself, ""and to-morrow morning is the time.""  John Bodman had planned his crime as grimly and relentlessly, and as coolly, as ever he had concocted a deal on the Stock Exchange. There was no thought in his mind of mercy for his unconscious victim. His hatred had carried him far.  The next morning after breakfast, he said to his wife: ""I intend to take a walk in the mountains. Do you wish to come with me?""  ""Yes,"" she answered briefly.  ""Very well, then,"" he said; ""I shall be ready at nine o'clock.""  ""I shall be ready at nine o'clock,"" she repeated after him.  At that hour they left the hotel together, to which he was shortly to return alone. They spoke no word to each other on their way to the Hanging Outlook. The path was practically level, skirting the mountains, for the Hanging Outlook was not much higher above the sea than the hotel.  John Bodman had formed no fixed plan for his procedure when the place was reached. He resolved to be guided by circumstances. Now and then a strange fear arose in his mind that she might cling to him and possibly drag him over the precipice with her. He found himself wondering whether she had any premonition of her fate, and one of his reasons for not speaking was the fear that a tremor in his voice might possibly arouse her suspicions. He resolved that his action should be sharp and sudden, that she might have no chance either to help herself or to drag him with her. Of her screams in that desolate region he had no fear. No one could reach the spot except from the hotel, and no one that morning had left the house, even for an expedition to the glacier--one of the easiest and most popular trips from the place.  Curiously enough, when they came within sight of the Hanging Outlook, Mrs. Bodman stopped and shuddered. Bodman looked at her through the narrow slits of his veiled eyes, and wondered again if she had any suspicion. No one can tell, when two people walk closely together, what unconscious communication one mind may have with another.  ","John Bodman, Mrs. Bodman",drama,suspenseful
"Vivienne was about twenty-one. She was of the purest Saxon type. Her hair was a ruddy golden, each filament of the neatly gathered mass shining with its own lustre and delicate graduation of colour. In perfect harmony were her ivory-clear complexion and deep sea-blue eyes that looked upon the world with the ingenuous calmness of a mermaid or the pixie of an undiscovered mountain stream. Her frame was strong and yet possessed the grace of absolute naturalness. And yet with all her Northern clearness and frankness of line and colouring, there seemed to be something of the tropics in her -- something of languor in the droop of her pose, of love of ease in her ingenious complacency of satisfaction and comfort in the mere act of breathing -- something that seemed to claim for her a right as a perfect work of nature to exist and be admired equally with a rare flower or some beautiful, milk-white dove among its sober-hued companions.  She was dressed in a white waist and dark skirt -- that discreet masquerade of goose-girl and duchess.  ""Vivienne,"" said Hartley, looking at her pleadingly, ""you did not answer my last letter. It was only by nearly a week's search that I found where you had moved to. Why have you kept me in suspense when you knew how anxiously I was waiting to see you and hear from you?""

I realize all the advantages of your offer, and sometimes I feel sure that I could be contented with you. But, again, I am doubtful. I was born a city girl, and I am afraid to bind myself to a quiet suburban life.""

You shall come to the city for the theatres, for shopping and to visit your friends as often as you care to. You can trust me, can you not?""  ""To the fullest,"" she said, turning her frank eyes upon him with a smile. ""I know you are the kindest of men, and that the girl you get will be a lucky one. I learned all about you when I was at the Montgomerys'.""  ""Ah!"" exclaimed Hartley, with a tender, reminiscent light in his eye; ""I remember well the evening I first saw you at the Montgomerys'. Mrs. Montgomery was sounding your praises to me all the evening. And she hardly did you justice. I shall never forget that supper. Come, Vivienne, promise me. I want you.

"Who and where was Miggles? The Judge, our authority, did not remember the name, and he knew the country thoroughly. The Washoe traveler thought Miggles must keep a hotel. We only knew that we were stopped by high water in front and rear, and that Miggles was our rock of refuge. A ten minutes splashing through a tangled by- road, scarcely wide enough for the stage, and we drew up before a barred and boarded gate in a wide stone wall or fence about eight feet high.

So we rose up and called on Miggles in chorus; then separately. And when we had finished, a Hibernian fellow-passenger from the roof called for ""Maygells!"" whereat we all laughed. While we were laughing, the driver cried ""Shoo!""  We listened. To our infinite amazement the chorus of ""Miggles"" was repeated from the other side of the wall, even to the final and supplemental ""Maygells.""  ""Extraordinary echo,"" said the Judge.

"Corley's stride acknowledged the compliment. The swing of his burly body made his friend execute a few light skips from the path to the roadway and back again. Corley was the son of an inspector of police and he had inherited his father's frame and gut. He walked with his hands by his sides, holding himself erect and swaying his head from side to side. His head was large, globular and oily; it sweated in all weathers; and his large round hat, set upon it sideways, looked like a bulb which had grown out of another. He always stared straight before him as if he were on parade and, when he wished to gaze after someone in the street, it was necessary for him to move his body from the hips. At present he was about town. Whenever any job was vacant a friend was always ready to give him the hard word. He was often to be seen walking with policemen in plain clothes, talking earnestly. He knew the inner side of all affairs and was fond of delivering final judgments. He spoke without listening to the speech of his companions. His conversation was mainly about himself what he had said to such a person and what such a person had said to him and what he had said to settle the matter. When he reported these dialogues he aspirated the first letter of his name after the manner of Florentines.  Lenehan offered his friend a cigarette. As the two young men walked on through the crowd Corley occasionally turned to smile at some of the passing girls but Lenehan's gaze was fixed on the large faint moon circled with a double halo. He watched earnestly the passing of the grey web of twilight across its face. At length he said:  ""Well... tell me, Corley, I suppose you'll be able to pull it off all right, eh?""  Corley closed one eye expressively as an answer.  ""Is she game for that?"" asked Lenehan dubiously. ""You can never know women.""  ""She's all right,"" said Corley. ""I know the way to get around her, man. She's a bit gone on me.""  ""You're what I call a gay Lothario,"" said Lenehan. ""And the proper kind of a Lothario, too!""

After which he disliked the olive more than ever--until that night when he saw the first eatable specimen rolling across the shiny parquet floor, propelled towards him by the careless hand of a pretty girl, who then looked up into his eyes and smiled.  He was convinced that Eve, similarly, had rolled the apple towards Adam across the emerald sward of the first garden in the world.  He slept usually like the dead. It must have been something very real that made him open his eyes and sit up in bed alertly. There was a noise against his door. He listened. The room was still quite dark. It was early morning. The noise was not repeated.  ""Who's there?"" he asked in a sleepy whisper. ""What is it?""  The noise came again. Some one was scratching on the door. No, it was somebody tapping.  ""What do you want?"" he demanded in a louder voice. ""Come in,"" he added, wondering sleepily whether he was presentable. Either the hotel was on fire or the porter was waking the wrong person for some sunrise expedition.  Nothing happened. Wide awake now, he turned the switch on, but no light flooded the room. The electricians, he remembered with a curse, were out on strike. He fumbled for the matches, and as he did so a voice in the corridor became distinctly audible. It was just outside his door.

And the voice, although never having heard it before, he could not have recognised it, belonged, he knew suddenly, to the girl who had let the olive fall. In an instant he was out of bed. He lit a candle.  ""I'm coming,"" he called softly, as he slipped rapidly into some clothes. ""I'm sorry I've kept you. I shan't be a minute.""  ""Be quick then!"" he heard, while the candle flame slowly grew, and he found his garments. Less than three minutes later he opened the door and, candle in hand, peered into the dark passage.

But there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?"" ""I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground-floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him. ""'Well,' said I, 'the gentleman at No. 4.' ""'What, the red-headed man?' ""'Yes.' ""'Oh,' said he, 'his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.' ""'Where could I find him?' ""'Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul's.' ""I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross."" ""And what did you do then?"" asked Holmes. ""I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you."" ""And you did very wisely,"" said Holmes. ""Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear."" ""Grave enough!"" said Mr. Jabez Wilson. ""Why, I have lost four pound a week.""","Sherlock Holmes, Doctor (narrator), Mr. Jabez Wilson",mystery,humorous 
"""There were very many people in the world in those days. San Francisco alone held four millions—"" ""What is millions?"" Edwin interrupted. Granser looked at him kindly. ""I know you cannot count beyond ten, so I will tell you. Hold up your two hands. On both of them you have altogether ten fingers and thumbs. Very well. I now take this grain of sand—you hold it, Hoo-Hoo."" He dropped the grain of sand into the lad's palm and went on. ""Now that grain of sand stands for the ten fingers of Edwin. I add another grain. That's ten more fingers. And I add another, and another, and another, until I have added as many grains as Edwin has fingers and thumbs. That makes what I call one hundred. Remember that word—one hundred. Now I put this pebble in Hare-Lip's hand. It stands for ten grains of sand, or ten tens of fingers, or one hundred fingers. I put in ten pebbles. They stand for a thousand fingers. I take a mussel-shell, and it stands for ten pebbles, or one hundred grains of sand, or one thousand fingers...."" And so on, laboriously, and with much reiteration, he strove to build up in their minds a crude conception of numbers. As the quantities increased, he had the boys holding different magnitudes in each of their hands. For still higher sums, he laid the symbols on the log of driftwood; and for symbols he was hard put, being compelled to use the teeth from the skulls for millions, and the crab-shells for billions. It was here that he stopped, for the boys were showing signs of becoming tired. ""There were four million people in San Francisco—four teeth."" The boys' eyes ranged along from the teeth and from hand to hand, down through the pebbles and sand-grains to Edwin's fingers. And back again they ranged along the ascending series in the effort to grasp such inconceivable numbers. ""That was a lot of folks, Granser,"" Edwin at last hazarded. ""Like sand on the beach here, like sand on the beach, each grain of sand a man, or woman, or child. Yes, my boy, all those people lived right here in San Francisco. And at one time or another all those people came out on this very beach—more people than there are grains of sand. More—more—more. And San Francisco was a noble city. And across the bay—where we camped last year, even more people lived, clear from Point Richmond, on the level ground and on the hills, all the way around to San Leandro—one great city of seven million people.—Seven teeth... there, that's it, seven millions.""

"We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes. ""You are not very vulnerable from above,"" Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him. ""Nor from below,"" said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. ""Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!"" he remarked, looking up in surprise. ""I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!"" said Holmes severely. ""You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?"" The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket. ""We have at least an hour before us,"" he remarked, ""for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor—as no doubt you have divined—in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present."" ""It is our French gold,"" whispered the director. ""We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it."" ""Your French gold?"" ""Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar."""," Sherlock Holmes, Mr. Merryweather, Dr. Watson",mystery,suspenseful
"Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of ""Fire!"" The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill—gentlemen, ostlers, and servant-maids—joined in a general shriek of ""Fire!"" Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend's arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road. ""You did it very nicely, Doctor,"" he remarked. ""Nothing could have been better. It is all right."" ""You have the photograph?"" ""I know where it is."" ""And how did you find out?"" ""She showed me, as I told you she would."" ""I am still in the dark."" ""I do not wish to make a mystery,"" said he, laughing. ""The matter was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice."" ""I guessed as much."" ""Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick."" ""That also I could fathom."" ""Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could she do?

"High atop the steps of the Pyramid of Giza a young woman laughed and called down to him. “Robert, hurry up! I knew I should have married a younger man!” Her smile was magic. He struggled to keep up, but his legs felt like stone. “Wait,” he begged. “Please . . .” As he climbed, his vision began to blur. There was a thundering in his ears. I must reach her! But when he looked up again, the woman had disappeared. In her place stood an old man with rotting teeth. The man stared down, curling his lips into a lonely grimace. Then he let out a scream of anguish that resounded across the desert. Robert Langdon awoke with a start from his nightmare. The phone beside his bed was ringing. Dazed, he picked up the receiver. “Hello?” “I’m looking for Robert Langdon,” a man’s voice said. Langdon sat up in his empty bed and tried to clear his mind. “This . . . is Robert Langdon.” He squinted at his digital clock. It was 5:18 A.M. “I must see you immediately.” “Who is this?” “My name is Maximilian Kohler. I’m a discrete particle physicist.” “A what?” Langdon could barely focus. “Are you sure you’ve got the right Langdon?” “You’re a professor of religious iconology at Harvard University. You’ve written three books on symbology and—” “Do you know what time it is?” “I apologize. I have something you need to see. I can’t discuss it on the phone.”A knowing groan escaped Langdon’s lips. This had happened before. One of the perils of writing books about religious symbology was the calls from religious zealots who wanted him to confirm their latest sign from God. Last month a stripper from Oklahoma had promised Langdon the best sex of his life if he would fly down and verify the authenticity of a cruciform that had magically appeared on her bed sheets. The Shroud of Tulsa, Langdon had called it. “How did you get my number?” Langdon tried to be polite, despite the hour. “On the Worldwide Web. The site for your book.” Langdon frowned. He was damn sure his book’s site did not include his home phone number. The man was obviously lying. “I need to see you,” the caller insisted. “I’ll pay you well.” Now Langdon was getting mad. “I’m sorry, but I really—” “If you leave immediately, you can be here by—” “I’m not going anywhere! It’s five o’clock in the morning!” Langdon hung up and collapsed back in bed. He closed his eyes and tried to fall back asleep. It was no use. The dream was emblazoned in his mind. Reluctantly, he put on his robe and went downstairs.","Robert Langdon, Maximilian Kohler",mystery,suspenseful
"Hundreds of miles from CERN, a voice crackled through a walkie-talkie. “Okay, I’m in the hallway.” The technician monitoring the video screens pressed the button on his transmitter. “You’re looking for camera #86. It’s supposed to be at the far end.” There was a long silence on the radio. The waiting technician broke a light sweat. Finally his radio clicked. “The camera isn’t here,” the voice said. “I can see where it was mounted, though. Somebody must have removed it.” The technician exhaled heavily. “Thanks. Hold on a second, will you?” Sighing, he redirected his attention to the bank of video screens in front of him. Huge portions of the complex were open to the public, and wireless cameras had gone missing before, usually stolen by visiting pranksters looking for souvenirs. But as soon as a camera left the facility and was out of range, the signal was lost, and the screen went blank. Perplexed, the technician gazed up at the monitor. A crystal clear image was still coming from camera #86. If the camera was stolen, he wondered, why are we still getting a signal? He knew, of course, there was only one explanation. The camera was still inside the complex, and someone had simply moved it. But who? And why? He studied the monitor a long moment. Finally he picked up his walkietalkie. “Are there any closets in that stairwell? Any cupboards or dark alcoves?” The voice replying sounded confused. “No. Why?” The technician frowned. “Never mind. Thanks for your help.” He turned off his walkie-talkie and pursed his lips. Considering the small size of the video camera and the fact that it was wireless, the technician knew that camera #86 could be transmitting from just about anywhere within the heavily guarded compound—a densely packed collection of thirty-two separate buildings covering a half-mile radius. The only clue was that the camera seemed to have been placed somewhere dark. Of course, that wasn’t much help. The complex contained endless dark locations —maintenance closets, heating ducts, gardening sheds, bedroom wardrobes, even a labyrinth of underground tunnels. Camera #86 could take weeks to locate. But that’s the least of my problems, he thought. Despite the dilemma posed by the camera’s relocation, there was another far more unsettling matter at hand.

"Do I have your attention now?” the man’s voice said when Langdon finally answered the line. “Yes, sir, you damn well do. You want to explain yourself?” “I tried to tell you before.” The voice was rigid, mechanical. “I’m a physicist. I run a research facility. We’ve had a murder. You saw the body.” “How did you find me?” Langdon could barely focus. His mind was racing from the image on the fax. “I already told you. The Worldwide Web. The site for your book, The Art of the Illuminati.” Langdon tried to gather his thoughts. His book was virtually unknown in mainstream literary circles, but it had developed quite a following on-line. Nonetheless, the caller’s claim still made no sense. “That page has no contact information,” Langdon challenged. “I’m certain of it.” “I have people here at the lab very adept at extracting user information from the Web.” Langdon was skeptical. “Sounds like your lab knows a lot about the Web.” “We should,” the man fired back. “We invented it.” Something in the man’s voice told Langdon he was not joking. “I must see you,” the caller insisted. “This is not a matter we can discuss on the phone. My lab is only an hour’s flight from Boston.” Langdon stood in the dim light of his study and analyzed the fax in his hand. The image was overpowering, possibly representing the epigraphical find of the century, a decade of his research confirmed in a single symbol. “It’s urgent,” the voice pressured. Langdon’s eyes were locked on the brand. Illuminati, he read over and over. His work had always been based on the symbolic equivalent of fossils—ancient documents and historical hearsay—but this image before him was today. Present tense. He felt like a paleontologist coming face to face with a living dinosaur. “I’ve taken the liberty of sending a plane for you,” the voice said. “It will be in Boston in twenty minutes.” Langdon felt his mouth go dry. An hour’s flight . . . “Please forgive my presumption,” the voice said. “I need you here.” Langdon looked again at the fax—an ancient myth confirmed in black and white. The implications were frightening. He gazed absently through the bay window. The first hint of dawn was sifting through the birch trees in his backyard, but the view looked somehow different this morning. As an odd combination of fear and exhilaration settled over him, Langdon knew he had no choice. “You win,” he said. “Tell me where to meet the plane.”","Langdon, The man on the phone",mystery,suspenseful
"""The field is small,"" Kohler said, ""but it's bringing fresh answers to some old questions, questions about the origin of the universe and the forces that bind us all. Leonardo believed his research had the potential to convert millions to a more spiritual life. Last year he categorically proved the existence of an energy force that unites us all. He actually demonstrated that we are all physically connected . . . that the molecules in your body are intertwined with the molecules in mine . . . that there is a single force moving within all of us."" Langdon felt disconcerted. And the power of God shall unite us all. Mr. Vetra actually found a way to demonstrate that particles are connected?Conclusive evidence. A recent Scientific American article hailed New Physics as a surer path to God than religion itself. The comment hit home. Langdon suddenly found himself thinking of the antireligious Illuminati. Reluctantly, he forced himself to permit a momentary intellectual foray into the impossible. If the Illuminati were indeed still active, would they have killed Leonardo to stop him from bringing his religious message to the masses? Langdon shook off the thought. Absurd! The Illuminati are ancient history! All academics know that! ""Vetra had plenty of enemies in the scientific world,"" Kohler went on. ""Many scientific purists despised him. Even here at CERN. They felt that using analytical physics to support religious principles was a treason against science."" ""But aren't scientists today a bit less defensive about the church?"" Kohler grunted in disgust. ""Why should we be? The church may not be burning scientists at the stake anymore, but if you think they've released their reign over science, ask yourself why half the schools in your country are not allowed to teach evolution. Ask yourself why the U.S. Christian Coalition is the most influential lobby against scientific progress in the world. The battle between science and religion is still raging, Mr. Langdon. It has moved from the battlefields to the boardrooms, but it is still raging."" Langdon realized Kohler was right.","Kohler, Langdon, Mr. Vetra",fiction,serious
"Not many children could say they remembered the day they met their father, but Vittoria Vetra could. She was eight years old, living where she always had, Orfanotrofio di Siena, a Catholic orphanage near Florence, deserted by parents she never knew. It was raining that day. The nuns had called for her twice to come to dinner, but as always she pretended not to hear. She lay outside in the courtyard, staring up at the raindrops . . . feeling them hit her body . . . trying to guess where one would land next. The nuns called again, threatening that pneumonia might make an insufferably headstrong child a lot less curious about nature. I can’t hear you, Vittoria thought. She was soaked to the bone when the young priest came out to get her. She didn’t know him. He was new there. Vittoria waited for him to grab her and drag her back inside. But he didn’t. Instead, to her wonder, he lay down beside her, soaking his robes in a puddle. “They say you ask a lot of questions,” the young man said. Vittoria scowled. “Are questions bad?” He laughed. “Guess they were right.” “What are you doing out here?” “Same thing you’re doing . . . wondering why raindrops fall.” “I’m not wondering why they fall! I already know!” The priest gave her an astonished look. “You do?” “Sister Francisca says raindrops are angels’ tears coming down to wash away our sins.” “Wow!” he said, sounding amazed. “So that explains it.” “No it doesn’t!” the girl fired back. “Raindrops fall because everything falls! Everything falls! Not just rain!” The priest scratched his head, looking perplexed. “You know, young lady, you’re right. Everything does fall. It must be gravity.” “It must be what?” He gave her an astonished look. “You haven’t heard of gravity?” “No.” The priest shrugged sadly. “Too bad. Gravity answers a lot of questions.” Vittoria sat up. “What’s gravity?” she demanded. “Tell me!” The priest gave her a wink. “What do you say I tell you over dinner.” The young priest was Leonardo Vetra. Although he had been an awardwinning physics student while in university, he’d heard another call and gone into the seminary. Leonardo and Vittoria became unlikely best friends in the lonely world of nuns and regulations. Vittoria made Leonardo laugh, and he took her under his wing, teaching her that beautiful things like rainbows and the rivers had many explanations. He told her about light, planets, stars, and all of nature through the eyes of both God and science. Vittoria’s innate intellect and curiosity made her a captivating student. Leonardo protected her like a daughter.","Vittoria Vetra, Father Leonardo Vetra, Sister Francisca",drama,optimistic
"Phileas Fogg rightly suspected that his departure from London would create a lively sensation at the West End. The news of the bet spread through the Reform Club, and afforded an exciting topic of conversation to its members. From the club it soon got into the papers throughout England. The boasted ""tour of the world"" was talked about, disputed, argued with as much warmth as if the subject were another Alabama claim. Some took sides with Phileas Fogg, but the large majority shook their heads and declared against him; it was absurd, impossible, they declared, that the tour of the world could be made, except theoretically and on paper, in this minimum of time, and with the existing means of travelling. The Times, Standard, Morning Post, and Daily News, and twenty other highly respectable newspapers scouted Mr. Fogg's project as madness; the Daily Telegraph alone hesitatingly supported him. People in general thought him a lunatic, and blamed his Reform Club friends for having accepted a wager which betrayed the mental aberration of its proposer.  Articles no less passionate than logical appeared on the question, for geography is one of the pet subjects of the English; and the columns devoted to Phileas Fogg's venture were eagerly devoured by all classes of readers. At first some rash individuals, principally of the gentler sex, espoused his cause, which became still more popular when the Illustrated London News came out with his portrait, copied from a photograph in the Reform Club. A few readers of the Daily Telegraph even dared to say, ""Why not, after all? Stranger things have come to pass.""  At last a long article appeared, on the 7th of October, in the bulletin of the Royal Geographical Society, which treated the question from every point of view, and demonstrated the utter folly of the enterprise.  Everything, it said, was against the travellers, every obstacle imposed alike by man and by nature. A miraculous agreement of the times of departure and arrival, which was impossible, was absolutely necessary to his success. He might, perhaps, reckon on the arrival of trains at the designated hours, in Europe, where the distances were relatively moderate; but when he calculated upon crossing India in three days, and the United States in seven, could he rely beyond misgiving upon accomplishing his task?

"Presently we saw that the cavern before us opened upon a hazy void. In another moment we had emerged upon a sort of slanting gallery, that projected into a vast circular space, a huge cylindrical pit running vertically up and down. Round this pit the slanting gallery ran without any parapet or protection for a turn and a half, and then plunged high above into the rock again. Somehow it reminded me then one of those spiral turns of the railway through the Saint Gothard. It was all tremendously huge. I can scarcely hope to convey to you the Titanic proportion of all that place, the Titanic effect of it. Our eyes followed up the vast declivity of the pit wall, and overhead and far above we beheld a round opening set with faint stars, and half of the lip about it well nigh blinding with the white light of the sun. At that we cried aloud simultaneously.  ""Come on!"" I said, leading the way.  ""But there?"" said Cavor, and very carefully stepped nearer the edge of the gallery. I followed his example, and craned forward and looked down, but I was dazzled by that gleam of light above, and I could see only a bottomless darkness with spectral patches of crimson and purple floating therein. Yet if I could not see, I could hear. Out of this darkness came a sound, a sound like the angry hum one can hear if one puts one's ear outside a hive of bees, a sound out of that enormous hollow, it may be, four miles beneath our feet...  For a moment I listened, then tightened my grip on my crowbar, and led the way up the gallery.  ""This must be the shaft we looked down upon,"" said Cavor. ""Under that lid.""  ""And below there, is where we saw the lights.""  ""The lights!"" said he. ""Yes--the lights of the world that now we shall never see.""  ""We'll come back,"" I said, for now we had escaped so much I was rashly sanguine that we should recover the sphere.  His answer I did not catch.  ""Eh?"" I asked.  ""It doesn't matter,"" he answered, and we hurried on in silence.  I suppose that slanting lateral way was four or five miles long, allowing for its curvature, and it ascended at a slope that would have made it almost impossibly steep on earth, but which one strode up easily under lunar conditions.

"There was a whirr. The clock shuddered and all at once the door opened. The cuckoo came out, sliding swiftly. He paused and looked around solemnly, scrutinizing her, the room, the furniture.  It was the first time he had seen her, she realized, smiling to herself in pleasure. She stood up, coming toward him shyly. ""Go on,"" she said. ""I'm waiting.""  The cuckoo opened his bill. He whirred and chirped, quickly, rhythmically. Then, after a moment of contemplation, he retired. And the door snapped shut.  She was delighted. She clapped her hands and spun in a little circle. He was marvelous, perfect! And the way he had looked around, studying her, sizing her up. He liked her; she was certain of it. And she, of course, loved him at once, completely. He was just what she had hoped would come out of the little door.  Doris went to the clock. She bent over the little door, her lips close to the wood. ""Do you hear me?"" she whispered. ""I think you're the most wonderful cuckoo in the world."" She paused, embarrassed. ""I hope you'll like it here.""  Then she went downstairs again, slowly, her head high.  Larry and the cuckoo clock really never got along well from the start. Doris said it was because he didn't wind it right, and it didn't like being only half-wound all the time. Larry turned the job of winding over to her; the cuckoo came out every quarter hour and ran the spring down without remorse, and someone had to be ever after it, winding it up again.  Doris did her best, but she forgot a good deal of the time. Then Larry would throw his newspaper down with an elaborate weary motion and stand up. He would go into the dining-room where the clock was mounted on the wall over the fireplace. He would take the clock down and making sure that he had his thumb over the little door, he would wind it up.  ""Why do you put your thumb over the door?"" Doris asked once.  ""You're supposed to.""  She raised an eyebrow. ""Are you sure? I wonder if it isn't that you don't want him to come out while you're standing so close.""  ""Why not?""  ""Maybe you're afraid of him.""  Larry laughed.

"""In another moment we were standing face to face, I and this fragile thing out of futurity. He came straight up to me and laughed into my eyes. The absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at once. Then he turned to the two others who were following him and spoke to them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue.  ""There were others coming, and presently a little group of perhaps eight or ten of these exquisite creatures were about me. One of them addressed me. It came into my head, oddly enough, that my voice was too harsh and deep for them. So I shook my head, and, pointing to my ears, shook it again. He came a step forward, hesitated, and then touched my hand. Then I felt other soft little tentacles upon my back and shoulders. They wanted to make sure I was real. There was nothing in this at all alarming. Indeed, there was something in these pretty little people that inspired confidence, a graceful gentleness, a certain childlike ease. And besides, they looked so frail that I could fancy myself flinging the whole dozen of them about like nine-pins. But I made a sudden motion to warn them when I saw their little pink hands feeling at the Time Machine. Happily then, when it was not too late, I thought of a danger I had hitherto forgotten, and reaching over the bars of the machine I unscrewed the little levers that would set it in motion, and put these in my pocket. Then I turned again to see what I could do in the way of communication.  ""And then, looking more nearly into their features, I saw some further peculiarities in their Dresden china type of prettiness. Their hair, which was uniformly curly, came to a sharp end at the neck and cheek; there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the face, and their ears were singularly minute. The mouths were small, with bright red, rather thin lips, and the little chins ran to a point. The eyes were large and mild; and this may seem egotism on my part I fancied even that there was a certain lack of the interest I might have expected in them.  ""As they made no effort to communicate with me, but simply stood round me smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other, I began the conversation. I pointed to the Time Machine and to myself. Then hesitating for a moment how to express time, I pointed to the sun.

"Kramer leaned back. ""You can see the situation. How can we deal with a factor like this? The perfect variable.""  ""Perfect? Prediction should still be possible. A living thing still acts from necessity, the same as inanimate material. But the cause-effect chain is more subtle; there are more factors to be considered. The difference is quantitative, I think. The reaction of the living organism parallels natural causation, but with greater complexity.""  Gross and Kramer looked up at the board plates, suspended on the wall, still dripping, the images hardening into place. Kramer traced a line with his pencil.  ""See that? It's a pseudopodium. They're alive, and so far, a weapon we can't beat. No mechanical system can compete with that, simple or intricate. We'll have to scrap the Johnson Control and find something else.""  ""Meanwhile the war continues as it is. Stalemate. Checkmate. They can't get to us, and we can't get through their living minefield.""  Kramer nodded. ""It's a perfect defense, for them. But there still might be one answer.""  ""What's that?""  ""Wait a minute."" Kramer turned to his rocket expert, sitting with the charts and files. ""The heavy cruiser that returned this week. It didn't actually touch, did it? It came close but there was no contact.""  ""Correct."" The expert nodded. ""The mine was twenty miles off. The cruiser was in space-drive, moving directly toward Proxima, line-straight, using the Johnson Control, of course. It had deflected a quarter of an hour earlier for reasons unknown. Later it resumed its course. That was when they got it.""  ""It shifted,"" Kramer said. ""But not enough. The mine was coming along after it, trailing it. It's the same old story, but I wonder about the contact.""  ""Here's our theory,"" the expert said. ""We keep looking for contact, a trigger in the pseudopodium. But more likely we're witnessing a psychological phenomena, a decision without any physical correlative. We're watching for something that isn't there. The mine decides to blow up.

"One day Murlock returned from gunning in a distant part of the forest to find his wife prostrate with fever, and delirious. There was no physician within miles, no neighbor; nor was she in a condition to be left, to summon help. So he set about the task of nursing her back to health, but at the end of the third day she fell into unconsciousness arid so passed away, apparently, with never a gleam of returning reason.  From what we know of a nature like his we may venture to sketch in some of the details of the outline picture drawn by my grandfather. When convinced that she was dead, Murlock had sense enough to remember that the dead must be prepared for burial. In performance of this sacred duty he blundered now and again, did certain things incorrectly, and others which he did correctly were done over and over. His occasional failures to accomplish some simple and ordinary act filled him with astonishment, like that of a drunken man who wonders at the suspension of familiar natural laws. He was surprised, too, that he did not weep--surprised and a little ashamed; surely it is unkind not to weep for the dead. ""Tomorrow,"" he said aloud, ""I shall have to make the coffin arid dig the grave; and then I shall miss her, when she is no longer in sight; but now--she is dead, of course, but it is all right--it must be all right, somehow. Things cannot be so bad as they seem.""  He stood over the body in the fading light, adjusting the hair and putting the finishing touches to the simple toilet, doing all mechanically, with soulless care. And still through his consciousness ran an undersense of conviction that all was right--that he should have her again as before, and everything explained. He had had no experience in grief; his capacity had not been enlarged by use. His heart could not contain it all, nor his imagination rightly conceive it. He did not know he was so hard struck; that knowledge would come later, and never go. Grief is an artist of powers as various as the instruments upon which he plays his dirges for the dead, evoking from some the sharpest, shrillest notes, from others the low, grave chords that throb recurrent like the slow beating of a distant drum. Some natures it startles; some it stupefies. ","Murlock, Murlock's wife",horror,suspenseful
"The old people of the village came stooping along the street. Children, with bright faces, tripped merrily beside their parents, or mimicked a graver gait, in the conscious dignity of their Sunday clothes. Spruce bachelors looked sidelong at the pretty maidens, and fancied that the Sabbath sunshine made them prettier than on weekdays. When the throng had mostly streamed into the porch, the sexton began to toll the bell, keeping his eye on the Reverend Mr. Hooper's door. The first glimpse of the clergyman's figure was the signal for the bell to cease its summons.  ""But what has good Parson Hooper got upon his face?"" cried the sexton in astonishment.  All within hearing immediately turned about, and beheld the semblance of Mr. Hooper, pacing slowly his meditative way toward the meetinghouse. With one accord they started, expressing more wonder than if some strange minister were coming to dust the cushions of Mr. Hooper's pulpit.  ""Are you sure it is our parson?"" inquired Goodman Gray of the sexton.  ""Of a certainty it is good Mr. Hooper,"" replied the sexton. ""He was to have exchanged pulpits with Parson Shute, of Westbury; but Parson Shute sent to excuse himself yesterday, being to preach a funeral sermon.""  The cause of so much amazement may appear sufficiently slight. Mr. Hooper gentlemanly person, of about thirty, though still a bachelor, was dressed with due clerical neatness, as if a careful wife had starched his band, and brushed the weekly dust from his Sunday's garb. There was but one thing remarkable in his appearance. Swathed about his forehead, and hanging down over his face, so low as to be shaken by his breath Mr. Hooper had on a black veil. On a nearer view it seemed to consist of two folds of crepe, which entirely concealed his features, except the mouth and chin, but probably did not intercept his sight, further than to give a darkened aspect to all living and inanimate things. With this gloomy shade before him, good Mr. Hooper walked onward, at a slow and quiet pace, stooping somewhat, and looking on the ground, as is customary with abstracted men, yet nodding kindly to those of his parishioners who still waited on the meetinghouse steps. But so wonderstruck were they that his greeting hardly met with a return.  ""I can't really feel as if good Mr. Hooper's face was behind that piece of crape,"" said the sexton.  ""I don't like it,"" muttered an old woman, as she hobbled into the meetinghouse. ""He has changed himself into something awful, only by hiding his face.""  ""Our parson has gone mad!"" cried Goodman Gray, following him across the threshold."," The old people of the village, children, spruce bachelors, Reverend Mr. Hooper, sexton, Goodman Gray, old woman",fiction,mysterious
"Every Sunday he met in this very spot Monsieur Sauvage, a stout, jolly, little man, a draper in the Rue Notre Dame de Lorette, and also an ardent fisherman. They often spent half the day side by side, rod in hand and feet dangling over the water, and a warm friendship had sprung up between the two.  Some days they did not speak; at other times they chatted; but they understood each other perfectly without the aid of words, having similar tastes and feelings.  In the spring, about ten o'clock in the morning, when the early sun caused a light mist to float on the water and gently warmed the backs of the two enthusiastic anglers, Morissot would occasionally remark to his neighbor:  ""My, but it's pleasant here.""  To which the other would reply:  ""I can't imagine anything better!""  And these few words sufficed to make them understand and appreciate each other.  In the autumn, toward the close of day, when the setting sun shed a blood-red glow over the western sky, and the reflection of the crimson clouds tinged the whole river with red, brought a glow to the faces of the two friends, and gilded the trees, whose leaves were already turning at the first chill touch of winter, Monsieur Sauvage would sometimes smile at Morissot, and say:  ""What a glorious spectacle!""  And Morissot would answer, without taking his eyes from his float:  ""This is much better than the boulevard, isn't it?""  As soon as they recognized each other they shook hands cordially, affected at the thought of meeting under such changed circumstances.  Monsieur Sauvage, with a sigh, murmured:  ""These are sad times!""  Morissot shook his head mournfully.  ""And such weather! This is the first fine day of the year.""  The sky was, in fact, of a bright, cloudless blue.","Morissot, Monsieur Sauvage",fiction,serious
"She tried to speak to the little quadroon boy; but no sound would come, at first. When he heard his name uttered, he looked up, and his mistress was pointing to the door. He laid aside the great, soft fan, and obediently stole away, over the polished floor, on his bare tiptoes. She stayed motionless, with gaze riveted upon her child, and her face the picture of fright. Presently her husband entered the room, and without noticing her, went to a table and began to search among some papers which covered it. ""Armand,"" she called to him, in a voice which must have stabbed him, if he was human. But he did not notice. ""Armand,"" she said again. Then she rose and tottered towards him. ""Armand,"" she panted once more, clutching his arm, ""look at our child. What does it mean? Tell me."" He coldly but gently loosened her fingers from about his arm and thrust the hand away from him. ""Tell me what it means!"" she cried despairingly. ""It means,"" he answered lightly, ""that the child is not white; it means that you are not white."" A quick conception of all that this accusation meant for her nerved her with unwonted courage to deny it. ""It is a lie; it is not true, I am white! Look at my hair, it is brown; and my eyes are gray, Armand, you know they are gray. And my skin is fair,"" seizing his wrist. ""Look at my hand; whiter than yours, Armand,"" she laughed hysterically. ""As white as La Blanche's,"" he returned cruelly; and went away leaving her alone with their child. When she could hold a pen in her hand, she sent a despairing letter to Madame Valmonde. ""My mother, they tell me I am not white. Armand has told me I am not white. For God's sake tell them it is not true. You must know it is not true. I shall die. I must die. I cannot be so unhappy, and live."" The answer that came was brief: ""My own Desiree: Come home to Valmonde; back to your mother who loves you. Come with your child."" When the letter reached Desiree she went with it to her husband's study, and laid it open upon the desk before which he sat. She was like a stone image: silent, white, motionless after she placed it there.","Desiree, Armand (her husband), little quadroon boy, Madame Valmonde",drama,serious
"In the wan light, the faces of the men must have been grey. Their eyes must have glinted in strange ways as they gazed steadily astern. Viewed from a balcony, the whole thing would doubtless have been weirdly picturesque. But the men in the boat had no time to see it, and if they had had leisure there were other things to occupy their minds. The sun swung steadily up the sky, and they knew it was broad day because the color of the sea changed from slate to emerald-green, streaked with amber lights, and the foam was like tumbling snow. The process of the breaking day was unknown to them. They were aware only of this effect upon the color of the waves that rolled toward them.  In disjointed sentences the cook and the correspondent argued as to the difference between a life-saving station and a house of refuge. The cook had said: ""There's a house of refuge just north of the Mosquito Inlet Light, and as soon as they see us, they'll come off in their boat and pick us up.""  ""As soon as who see us?"" said the correspondent.  ""The crew,"" said the cook.  ""Houses of refuge don't have crews,"" said the correspondent. ""As I understand them, they are only places where clothes and grub are stored for the benefit of shipwrecked people. They don't carry crews.""  ""Oh, yes, they do,"" said the cook.

"All round them lay a thick-strewn wreckage of splintered branches and broken twigs.  Relief at being alive and exasperation at his captive plight brought a strange medley of pious thank-offerings and sharp curses to Ulrich's lips. Georg, who was early blinded with the blood which trickled across his eyes, stopped his struggling for a moment to listen, and then gave a short, snarling laugh.  ""So you're not killed, as you ought to be, but you're caught, anyway,"" he cried; ""caught fast. Ho, what a jest, Ulrich von Gradwitz snared in his stolen forest. There's real justice for you!""  And he laughed again, mockingly and savagely.  ""I'm caught in my own forest-land,"" retorted Ulrich. ""When my men come to release us you will wish, perhaps, that you were in a better plight than caught poaching on a neighbour's land, shame on you.""  Georg was silent for a moment; then he answered quietly:  ""Are you sure that your men will find much to release? I have men, too, in the forest to-night, close behind me, and _they_ will be here first and do the releasing. When they drag me out from under these damned branches it won't need much clumsiness on their part to roll this mass of trunk right over on the top of you. Your men will find you dead under a fallen beech tree. For form's sake I shall send my condolences to your family.""  ""It is a useful hint,"" said Ulrich fiercely. ""My men had orders to follow in ten minutes time, seven of which must have gone by already, and when they get me out--I will remember the hint. Only as you will have met your death poaching on my lands I don't think I can decently send any message of condolence to your family.""  ""Good,"" snarled Georg, ""good. We fight this quarrel out to the death, you and I and our foresters, with no cursed interlopers to come between us. Death and damnation to you, Ulrich von Gradwitz.""  ""The same to you, Georg Znaeym, forest-thief, game-snatcher.""

"From the lamppost something was hanging. A shapeless dark bundle, swinging a little with the wind. Like a dummy of some sort. Loyce rolled down his window and peered out. What the hell was it? A display of some kind? Sometimes the Chamber of Commerce put up displays in the square.  Again he made a U-turn and brought his car around. He passed the park and concentrated on the dark bundle. It wasn't a dummy. And if it was a display it was a strange kind. The hackles on his neck rose and he swallowed uneasily. Sweat slid out on his face and hands.  It was a body. A human body.  ""Look at it!"" Loyce snapped. ""Come on out here!""  Don Fergusson came slowly out of the store, buttoning his pin-stripe coat with dignity. ""This is a big deal, Ed. I can't just leave the guy standing there.""  ""See it?"" Ed pointed into the gathering gloom. The lamppost jutted up against the skyâ€”the post and the bundle swinging from it. ""There it is. How the hell long has it been there?"" His voice rose excitedly. ""What's wrong with everybody? They just walk on past!""  Don Fergusson lit a cigarette slowly. ""Take it easy, old man. There must be a good reason, or it wouldn't be there.""  ""A reason! What kind of a reason?""  Fergusson shrugged. ""Like the time the Traffic Safety Council put that wrecked Buick there.

Potter hurried off, joining the flow of people moving along the sidewalk. Men and women, passing by the park. A few glanced up curiously at the dark bundleâ€”and then went on. Nobody stopped. Nobody paid any attention.  ""I'm going nuts,"" Loyce whispered. He made his way to the curb and crossed out into traffic, among the cars. Horns honked angrily at him.

"Calixta, at home, felt no uneasiness for their safety. She sat at a side window sewing furiously on a sewing machine. She was greatly occupied and did not notice the approaching storm. But she felt very warm and often stopped to mop her face on which the perspiration gathered in beads. She unfastened her white sacque at the throat. It began to grow dark, and suddenly realizing the situation she got up hurriedly and went about closing windows and doors.  Out on the small front gallery she had hung Bobint's Sunday clothes to dry and she hastened out to gather them before the rain fell. As she stepped outside, Alce Laballire rode in at the gate. She had not seen him very often since her marriage, and never alone. She stood there with Bobint's coat in her hands, and the big rain drops began to fall. Alce rode his horse under the shelter of a side projection where the chickens had huddled and there were plows and a harrow piled up in the corner.  ""May I come and wait on your gallery till the storm is over, Calixta?"" he asked.  Come 'long in, M'sieur Alce.""  His voice and her own startled her as if from a trance, and she seized Bobint's vest. Alce, mounting to the porch, grabbed the trousers and snatched Bibi's braided jacket that was about to be carried away by a sudden gust of wind. He expressed an intention to remain outside, but it was soon apparent that he might as well have been out in the open: the water beat in upon the boards in driving sheets, and he went inside, closing the door after him. It was even necessary to put something beneath the door to keep the water out.  ""My! what a rain! It's good two years sence it rain' like that,"" exclaimed Calixta as she rolled up a piece of bagging and Alce helped her to thrust it beneath the crack.  She was a little fuller of figure than five years before when she married; but she had lost nothing of her vivacity. Her blue eyes still retained their melting quality; and her yellow hair, dishevelled by the wind and rain, kinked more stubbornly than ever about her ears and temples.  The rain beat upon the low, shingled roof with a force and clatter that threatened to break an entrance and deluge them there. They were in the dining room the sitting room the general utility room. Adjoining was her bed room, with Bibi's couch along side her own. The door stood open, and the room with its white, monumental bed, its closed shutters, looked dim and mysterious.  Alce flung himself into a rocker and Calixta nervously began to gather up from the floor the lengths of a cotton sheet which she had been sewing.","Calixta, Bobint, Alce Laballire, Bibi",romance,Romantic
"She did not stop to ask if it were or were not a monstrous joy that held her. A clear and exalted perception enabled her to dismiss the suggestion as trivial. She knew that she would weep again when she saw the kind, tender hands folded in death; the face that had never looked save with love upon her, fixed and gray and dead. But she saw beyond that bitter moment a long procession of years to come that would belong to her absolutely. And she opened and spread her arms out to them in welcome.  There would be no one to live for during those coming years; she would live for herself. There would be no powerful will bending hers in that blind persistence with which men and women believe they have a right to impose a private will upon a fellow-creature. A kind intention or a cruel intention made the act seem no less a crime as she looked upon it in that brief moment of illumination.  And yet she had loved him--sometimes. Often she had not. What did it matter! What could love, the unsolved mystery, count for in the face of this possession of self-assertion which she suddenly recognized as the strongest impulse of her being!  ""Free! Body and soul free!"" she kept whispering.  Josephine was kneeling before the closed door with her lips to the keyhole, imploring for admission. ""Louise, open the door! I beg; open the door--you will make yourself ill. What are you doing, Louise? For heaven's sake open the door.""  ""Go away. I am not making myself ill."" No; she was drinking in a very elixir of life through that open window.  Her fancy was running riot along those days ahead of her. Spring days, and summer days, and all sorts of days that would be her own. She breathed a quick prayer that life might be long. It was only yesterday she had thought with a shudder that life might be long.  She arose at length and opened the door to her sister's importunities. There was a feverish triumph in her eyes, and she carried herself unwittingly like a goddess of Victory. She clasped her sister's waist, and together they descended the stairs. Richards stood waiting for them at the bottom.  Someone was opening the front door with a latchkey. It was Brently Mallard who entered, a little travel-stained, composedly carrying his grip-sack and umbrella. He had been far from the scene of the accident, and did not even know there had been one. He stood amazed at Josephine's piercing cry; at Richards' quick motion to screen him from the view of his wife.

Mrs. Farquhar was only too happy to serve him with her own white hands. While she was fetching the water her husband approached the dusty horseman and inquired eagerly for news from the front.  ""The Yanks are repairing the railroads,"" said the man, ""and are getting ready for another advance. They have reached the Owl Creek bridge, put it in order and built a stockade on the north bank. The commandant has issued an order, which is posted everywhere, declaring that any civilian caught interfering with the railroad, its bridges, tunnels or trains will be summarily hanged. I saw the order.""  ""How far is it to the Owl Creek bridge?"" Farquhar asked.  ""About thirty miles.""  ""Is there no force on this side the creek?""  ""Only a picket post half a mile out, on the railroad, and a single sentinel at this end of the bridge.""  ""Suppose a man--a civilian and student of hanging--should elude the picket post and perhaps get the better of the sentinel,"" said Farquhar, smiling, ""what could he accomplish?""  The soldier reflected. ""I was there a month ago,"" he replied. ""I observed that the flood of last winter had lodged a great quantity of driftwood against the wooden pier at this end of the bridge. It is now dry and would burn like tow.""  The lady had now brought the water, which the soldier drank. He thanked her ceremoniously, bowed to her husband and rode away.

"""Do you think, Colonel, that your brave Coulter would like to put one of his guns in here?"" the general asked.  He was apparently not altogether serious; it certainly did not seem a place where any artillerist, however brave, would like to put a gun. The colonel thought that possibly his division commander meant good-humoredly to intimate that in a recent conversation between them Captain Coulter's courage had been too highly extolled.  ""General,"" he replied warmly, ""Coulter would like to put a gun anywhere within reach of those people,"" with a motion of his hand in the direction of the enemy.  ""It is the only place,"" said the general. He was serious, then.  The place was a depression, a ""notch,"" in the sharp crest of a hill. It was a pass, and through it ran a turnpike, which reaching this highest point in its course by a sinuous ascent through a thin forest made a similar, though less steep, descent toward the enemy. For a mile to the left and a mile to the right, the ridge, though occupied by Federal infantry lying close behind the sharp crest and appearing as if held in place by atmospheric pressure, was inaccessible to artillery. There was no place but the bottom of the notch, and that was barely wide enough for the roadbed. From the Confederate side this point was commanded by two batteries posted on a slightly lower elevation beyond a creek, and a half-mile away. All the guns but one were masked by the trees of an orchard; that one--it seemed a bit of impudence--was on an open lawn directly in front of a rather grandiose building, the planter's dwelling. The gun was safe enough in its exposure--but only because the Federal infantry had been forbidden to fire. Coulter's Notch--it came to be called so--was not, that pleasant summer afternoon, a place where one would ""like to put a gun.""  Three or four dead horses lay there sprawling in the road, three or four dead men in a trim row at one side of it, and a little back, down the hill. All but one were cavalrymen belonging to the Federal advance. One was a quartermaster. The general commanding the division and the colonel commanding the brigade, with their staffs and escorts, had ridden into the notch to have a look at the enemy's guns--which had straightway obscured themselves in towering clouds of smoke. It was hardly profitable to be curious about guns which had the trick of the cuttle-fish, and the season of observation had been brief.","Colonel, General, Captain Coulter",fiction,Serious

However, my maid can lend you things for the night,"" and she led the way to her car.  During the drive to the Quabarl mansion Lady Carlotta was impressively introduced to the nature of the charge that had been thrust upon her; she learned that Claude and Wilfrid were delicate, sensitive young people, that Irene had the artistic temperament highly developed, and that Viola was something or other else of a mould equally commonplace among children of that class and type in the twentieth century.

He had expected to stay only about three months, at the longest. When a man with as many friends on the outside as Jimmy Valentine had is received in the ""stir"" it is hardly worth while to cut his hair.  ""Now, Valentine,"" said the warden, ""you'll go out in the morning. Brace up, and make a man of yourself. You're not a bad fellow at heart. Stop cracking safes, and live straight.""  ""Me?"" said Jimmy, in surprise. ""Why, I never cracked a safe in my life.""  ""Oh, no,"" laughed the warden. ""Of course not. Let's see, now. How was it you happened to get sent up on that Springfield job? Was it because you wouldn't prove an alibi for fear of compromising somebody in extremely high-toned society?

"Jerton had not harboured the least intention of extending his thirst for name-labels to his neighbour. After her rather remarkable announcement, however, he was obliged to say something in the way of polite inquiry.  ""Yes,"" answered the lady, ""I suppose it is a case of partial loss of memory. I was in the train coming down here; my ticket told me that I had come from Victoria and was bound for this place. I had a couple of five-pound notes and a sovereign on me, no visiting cards or any other means of identification, and no idea as to who I am. I can only hazily recollect that I have a title; I am Lady Somebody - beyond that my mind is a blank.""  ""Hadn't you any luggage with you?"" asked Jerton.  ""That is what I didn't know. I knew the name of this hotel and made up my mind to come here, and when the hotel porter who meets the trains asked if I had any luggage I had to invent a dressing-bag and dress-basket; I could always pretend that they had gone astray. I gave him the name of Smith, and presently he emerged from a confused pile of luggage and passengers with a dressing- bag and dress-basket labelled Kestrel-Smith. I had to take them; I don't see what else I could have done.""  Jerton said nothing, but he rather wondered what the lawful owner of the baggage would do.  ""Of course it was dreadful arriving at a strange hotel with the name of Kestrel-Smith, but it would have been worse to have arrived without luggage. Anyhow, I hate causing trouble.""  Jerton had visions of harassed railway officials and distraught Kestrel-Smiths, but he made no attempt to clothe his mental picture in words. The lady continued her story.  ""Naturally, none of my keys would fit the things, but I told an intelligent page boy that I had lost my key-ring, and he had the locks forced in a twinkling. Rather too intelligent, that boy; he will probably end in Dartmoor. The Kestrel-Smith toilet tools aren't up to much, but they are better than nothing.""  ""If you feel sure that you have a title,"" said Jerton, "" why not get hold of a peerage and go right through it?""  ""I tried that.

Nothing more formidable,"" said Van Cheele. The artist said nothing.  ""What did you mean about a wild beast?"" said Van Cheele later, when they were on the platform.  ""Nothing. My imagination. Here is the train,"" said Cunningham.  That afternoon Van Cheele went for one of his frequent rambles through his woodland property. He had a stuffed bittern in his study, and knew the names of quite a number of wild flowers, so his aunt had possibly some justification in describing him as a great naturalist. At any rate, he was a great walker. It was his custom to take mental notes of everything he saw during his walks, not so much for the purpose of assisting contemporary science as to provide topics for conversation afterwards. When the bluebells began to show themselves in flower he made a point of informing every one of the fact; the season of the year might have warned his hearers of the likelihood of such an occurrence, but at least they felt that he was being absolutely frank with them.  What Van Cheele saw on this particular afternoon was, however, something far removed from his ordinary range of experience. On a shelf of smooth stone overhanging a deep pool in the hollow of an oak coppice a boy of about sixteen lay asprawl, drying his wet brown limbs luxuriously in the sun. His wet hair, parted by a recent dive, lay close to his head, and his light-brown eyes, so light that there was an almost tigerish gleam in them, were turned towards Van Cheele with a certain lazy watchfulness. It was an unexpected apparition, and Van Cheele found himself engaged in the novel process of thinking before he spoke. Where on earth could this wild-looking boy hail from? The miller's wife had lost a child some two months ago, supposed to have been swept away by the mill-race, but that had been a mere baby, not a half-grown lad.  ""What are you doing there?"" he demanded.  ","Van Cheele, Artist Cunningham, Wild boy",mystery,suspenseful
"Langdon strode silently behind Vittoria and Kohler as they moved back into the main atrium where Langdon’s bizarre visit had begun. Vittoria’s legs drove in fluid efficiency—like an Olympic diver—a potency, Langdon figured, no doubt born from the flexibility and control of yoga. He could hear her breathing slowly and deliberately, as if somehow trying to filter her grief. Langdon wanted to say something to her, offer his sympathy. He too had once felt the abrupt hollowness of unexpectedly losing a parent. He remembered the funeral mostly, rainy and gray. Two days after his twelfth birthday. The house was filled with gray-suited men from the office, men who squeezed his hand too hard when they shook it. They were all mumbling words like cardiac and stress. His mother joked through teary eyes that she’d always been able to follow the stock market simply by holding her husband’s hand . . . his pulse her own private ticker tape. Once, when his father was alive, Langdon had heard his mom begging his father to “stop and smell the roses.” That year, Langdon bought his father a tiny blown glass rose for Christmas. It was the most beautiful thing Langdon had ever seen . . . the way the sun caught it, throwing a rainbow of colors on the wall. “It’s lovely,” his father had said when he opened it, kissing Robert on the forehead. “Let’s find a safe spot for it.” Then his father had carefully placed the rose on a high dusty shelf in the darkest corner of the living room. A few days later, Langdon got a stool, retrieved the rose, and took it back to the store. His father never noticed it was gone. The ping of an elevator pulled Langdon back to the present. Vittoria and Kohler were in front of him, boarding the lift. Langdon hesitated outside the open doors. “Is something wrong?” Kohler asked, sounding more impatient than concerned. “Not at all,” Langdon said, forcing himself toward the cramped carriage. He only used elevators when absolutely necessary. He preferred the more open spaces of stairwells. “Dr. Vetra’s lab is subterranean,” Kohler said. Wonderful, Langdon thought as he stepped across the cleft, feeling an icy wind churn up from the depths of the shaft. The doors closed, and the car began to descend. “Six stories,” Kohler said blankly, like an analytical engine. Langdon pictured the darkness of the empty shaft below them. He tried to block it out by staring at the numbered display of changing floors. ","Robert Langdon, Vittoria Vetra, Maximilian Kohler, Bob Brownell, Charles Pratt",fiction,suspenseful
"The three children stared at George in the greatest surprise. George stared back at them. ""What do you mean?"" said Dick, at last. ""Kirrin Island can't belong to you. You're just boasting."" ""No, I'm not,"" said George. ""You ask Mother. If you're not going to believe what I say I won't tell you another word more. But I don't tell untruths. I think it's being a coward if you don't tell the truth— and I'm not a coward."" Julian remembered that Aunt Fanny had said that George was absolutely truthful, and he scratched his head and looked at George again. How could she be possibly telling the truth? ""Well, of course we'll believe you if you tell us the truth,"" he said. ""But it does sound a bit extraordinary, you know. Really it does. Children don't usually own islands, even funny little ones like that."" ""It isn't a funny little island,"" said George, fiercely. ""It's lovely. There are rabbits there, as tame as can be— and the big cormorants sit on the other side— and all kinds of gulls go there. The castle is wonderful too, even if it is all in ruins."" ""It sounds fine,"" said Dick. ""How does it belong to you, Georgina?"" George glared at him and didn't answer. ""Sorry,"" said Dick, hastily. ""I didn't mean to call you Georgina. I meant to call you George."" ""Go on, George— tell us how the island belongs to you,"" said Julian, slipping his arm through his sulky little cousin's. She pulled away from him at once. ""Don't do that,"" she said. ""I'm not sure that I want to make friends with you yet."" ""All right, all right,"" said Julian, losing patience. ""Be enemies or anything you like. We don't care. But we like your mother awfully, and we don't want her to think we won't make friends with you."" ""Do you like my mother?"" said George, her bright blue eyes softening a little. ""Yes— she's a dear, isn't she? Well— all right— I'll tell you how Kirrin Castle belongs to me. Come and sit down here in this corner where nobody can hear us."" They all sat down in a sandy corner of the beach. George looked across at the little island in the bay.","George, Dick, Julian, Aunt Fanny",fiction,optimistic
